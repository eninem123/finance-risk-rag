《履行持续义务：主要证券交易所上市公司手册》
Introduction
引言
This book, Meeting Continuing Obligations: A Handbook for Companies Listed on
Major Stock Exchanges, is a comprehensive guide designed to assist companies listed
on stock exchanges in the Chinese Mainland, Hong Kong SAR, the United States and
Singapore in navigating their continuing obligations.
《履行持续义务：主要证券交易所上市公司手册》是一本旨在协助于中国内地、
中国香港、美国和新加坡证券交易所上市的公司熟悉其持续义务的综合指南。
It offers a detailed examination of the listing rules pertinent to these stock exchanges,
addressing key areas such as regular disclosure, approval and disclosure of transactions,
transactions involving related parties, disclosure of material non-public information,
trading activities by substantial shareholders, directors, and supervisors, post-listing
share incentive plans, share repurchases, and restrictions on publicity.
本手册详细探讨了上述交易所的上市规则，涵盖常规披露、交易审批和披露、
关联交易、重要非公开信息披露、主要股东、董事和监事的交易活动、上市后
股份激励计划、股份回购及宣传限制等关键领域。
Furthermore, this handbook discusses the recent regulatory developments such as the
Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act (HFCAA) and its interplay with the
auditing standards and oversight processes of the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board (PCAOB). These elements are essential for China-based companies
listed in the United States.
此外，本手册讨论了近期的监管动态，如《外国公司问责法案》（HFCAA）及
其与上市公司会计监督委员会（PCAOB）的审计准则和监督程序之间的相互影
响。这些因素对于在美国上市的中国公司至关重要。
The objective of this handbook is to provide listed companies, potential listing
applicants, and their compliance officers with the necessary knowledge and practical
insights to understand and adhere to key compliance obligations across these
jurisdictions. Understanding these requirements in different stock exchanges, each with
its own complexities, is vital for listed companies to ensure effective compliance.
本手册的目的是为上市公司、潜在的上市申请人及其合规人员提供必备知识和
实务洞见，以了解并遵守这些司法管辖区的关键合规义务。每一个交易所都有
其自身的复杂性，因此了解不同交易所的要求对于确保上市公司的有效合规是
不可或缺的。

This handbook also offers a comparative analysis of the different regulatory
frameworks in the Chinese Mainland, Hong Kong SAR, the United States and
Singapore. This comparative perspective allows readers to understand the similarities
and differences between these jurisdictions, thereby enabling them to make informed
decisions about their compliance strategies.
本手册还对中国内地、中国香港、美国和新加坡的不同监管框架进行了比较分
析。这种比较视角能让读者了解这些司法管辖区之间的异同，从而使他们能够
就其合规策略做出明智决策。
As the regulatory landscape changes from time to time, readers are encouraged to
consult with the respective stock exchanges, regulatory authorities and legal
professionals for the most up-to-date and accurate information regarding the latest
compliance requirements.
由于监管环境不时变化，我们建议读者向相应的证券交易所、监管机构和法律
专业人士咨询，以获取有关最新合规要求的最及时且准确的信息。

1. Regular disclosure of financial information
财务信息的定期披露
In accordance with the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (“US Securities
Exchange Act”) and related laws, regulations and stock exchange rules of the
United States of America (“US” or “United States”), companies listed on the
New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”) and the Nasdaq Stock Market (“Nasdaq”)
are required to file periodic reports with the United States Securities and
Exchange Commission (“SEC”) to disclose financial information every year,
including annual reports, quarterly reports (exempted for foreign private
issuers), semi-annual reports, etc.
根据美国《1934年证券交易法》（Securities Exchange Act of 1934，“《“美国
证券交易法》”）、相关法律法规及证券交易所规则，在美国纽约证券交易
所（New York Stock Exchange，“纽交所”）和纳斯达克证券交易所
（Nasdaq Stock Market，“纳斯达克”）上市的公司每年须向美国证券交
易委员会（United States Securities and Exchange Commission，“SEC”）
提交定期报告（Periodical Reports）披露其财务信息，包括年度报告、季
度报告（外国私人发行人豁免）、半年度报告等。
1.1 Release of financial information
财务信息的发布
1.1.1 Definition of foreign private issuer
外国私人发行人的定义
Generally, a Chinese (operating) company listed on the NYSE or Nasdaq can
qualify as a foreign private issuer defined under the US Securities Exchange Act
(“China-Based US-Listed Company”), and thus can benefit from rules
relating to foreign private issuers. This Section is based on such premises and
introduces specifically the US securities laws and regulations applicable to
China-Based US-Listed Companies.
一般而言，在美国纽交所及纳斯达克上市的中国（运营）公司（““中概股
上市公司”）可以符合《美国证券交易法》规定的外国私人发行人的定义，
因此中概股上市公司通常可以适用外国私人发行人的相关规则。本文将
基于该等假设，具体介绍适用于中概股上市公司的美国证券法律规则。
22

Meeting Continuing Obligations:

《履行持续义务：主要证券交易所上市公司手册》
According to the US Securities Exchange Act, a foreign private issuer means
any foreign nongovernmental issuer incorporated or organized under the laws
of any jurisdiction other than the US, but an issuer will not constitute a foreign
private issuer if it meets both of the following conditions:
根据《美国证券交易法》，外国私人发行人指根据美国以外之司法辖区的
法律组建成立的任何外国非政府机构的发行人，但同时满足以下条件的
发行人不构成外国私人发行人：
(1) more than 50% of the outstanding voting securities are held of record,
directly or indirectly, by US residents; and
50%以上具有投票权的流通证券直接或间接被美国居民持有；且
(2) it falls under any of the following circumstances:
满足以下任一条件：
(a) a majority of its executive officers or directors are US citizens or
residents;
其大多数高级管理人员或董事为美国公民或居民；
(b) more than 50% of its assets are located in the US; or
其50%以上的资产位于美国境内；或
(c) its businesses are administered principally in the US
主要在美国对其相关业务进行管理。
Listed foreign private issuers filing with the SEC must reassess their status as a
foreign private issuer as of the last business day of its second fiscal quarter each
year. If a China-Based US-Listed Company determines that as of the last
business day of its most recent second fiscal quarter it no longer qualifies as a
foreign private issuer, such Company and its executive officers, directors and/or
major shareholders will be subject to additional disclosure requirements starting
from the next fiscal year, including but not limited to the preparation of financial
statements in accordance with the United States Generally Accepted Accounting
Principles (“US GAAP”) or the provision of financial statements reconciled to
US GAAP, the disclosure of quarterly reports, the shortening of annual report
disclosure deadlines.
向 SEC 申报的已上市外国私人发行人必须在每年第二个财政季度的最后
一个工作日重新评估其作为外国私人发行人的身份。如果中概股上市公
司在最近的第二个财政季度的最后一个工作日确定其不再符合外国私人

发行人的资格，则该中概股上市公司及其高级管理人员、董事和/或主要
股东在下一财政年度开始时将需要遵守额外的信息披露要求，包括根据
美国通用会计准则（United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles，
“US GAAP”）准备财务报表或提供根据 US GAAP核对调整的财务报表、
披露季度报告、年度报告披露期限缩短等。
1.1.2 Quarterly Reports and Form 6-K
季度报告及 6-K表格
Foreign private issuers are not legally required to regularly disclose quarterly
reports to the SEC. However, if a China-Based US-Listed Company, as a foreign
private issuer, voluntarily chooses to disclose quarterly financial information
like most domestic US-listed companies, it should file with the SEC its quarterly
earnings release on Form 6-K promptly after the issuance of its quarterly
earnings release to the public.
外国私人发行人没有法定义务向 SEC 定期披露季度报告。然而，如果中
概股上市公司作为外国私人发行人自愿选择如大多数美国本土上市公司
一样披露其季度报告，则在其季度报告对公众发布后应及时以 6-K 表格
的形式向 SEC提交该等季度报告。
1.1.3 Semi-Annual Reports and Form 6-K
半年度报告及 6-K表格
In addition, China-Based US-Listed Companies must comply with the
disclosure requirements of financial reports required for the NYSE and Nasdaq
respectively and file semi-annual reports via Form 6-K within 6 months after
the end of the second fiscal quarter of each year.
此外，在纽交所和纳斯达克上市的中概股上市公司必须遵守其各自的财
务报告披露要求，在每年第二财政季度结束后六个月内，通过 6-K 表格
提交半年度报告。
1.1.4 Annual Reports and Form 20-F
年度报告及 20-F表格
A China-Based US-Listed Company, as a foreign private issuer, must file annual
reports pursuant to the requirements of Form 20-F with the SEC within 4 months
of the end of each financial year. Form 20-F contains detailed and
comprehensive financial and non-financial information disclosure requirements.

1.1.5 Consequences of failure to timely disclose financial information
未能如期披露财务信息的后果
Failure of a China-Based US-Listed Company to file legally required periodic
reports in time may result in a series of adverse consequences, such as the
inability to use Form F-3, the inability to conduct facilitated additional offerings
as a WKSI (Well-Known Seasoned Issuer), the inability of its shareholders to
conduct a facilitated sales of stocks under Rule 144, etc.

《履行持续义务：主要证券交易所上市公司手册》
中概股上市公司如果未能按期提交法律要求的定期报告，可能将导致一
系列不利后果，例如无法使用 F-3 表格、无法作为知名成熟发行人
（Well-Known Seasoned Issuer）开展便利的增发、其股份持有人无法利
用144规则的便利出售股票等。
According to the NYSE rules, if a China-Based US-Listed Company (as a
foreign private issuer) fails to file its annual report or semi-annual report in time
(“Filing Delinquency”), the NYSE will immediately issue a written notification
to the company (“Filing Delinquency Notification”). Within 5 days after the
date of the Filing Delinquency Notification, the company will be required to:
根据纽交所规则，如中概股上市公司（作为外国私人发行人）未能按期
提交年度报告和半年度报告（“逾期申报”），纽交所将立即向公司发出书
面通知（“逾期申报通知书”）。在逾期申报通知书发出后的五日内，该公
司将被要求：
(1) contact the NYSE to discuss the status of the delinquent report;
与纽交所联系，讨论逾期申报的状况；
(2) issue a press release disclosing the occurrence of the Filing Delinquency,
the reason for the Filing Delinquency, and the anticipated date (if known,
as the case may be) by which the Filing Delinquency will be cured via
filing or refiling of the applicable report. If the company does not issue
the aforementioned press release within 5 days of the date of the Filing
Delinquency Notification, the NYSE will issue a press release stating that
a Filing Delinquency has occurred for the company and providing a
description thereof.
发布新闻稿，披露发生逾期申报的情况、逾期申报的原因、以及通
过提交或重新提交适用的报告以纠正该逾期申报的预期日期（如已
知，视情况而定）。如果公司在收到逾期申报通知书的五日内未发
布前述新闻稿，则纽交所将发布新闻稿说明公司已发生逾期申报。
For a period of 6 months from the date of the Filing Delinquency (the
“Initial Cure Period”), the NYSE will monitor the company and the
status of the delinquent report and subsequent reports and will contact the
company until the Filing Delinquency is cured. If the company fails to
cure the Filing Delinquency within the Initial Cure Period, the NYSE may,
at its sole discretion, allow up to additional 6 months for the company’s
securities to be traded and the Filing Delinquency to be cured (the
“Additional Cure Period”), depending on the specific circumstances of
26
--- Page 35 (Text) ---
Meeting Continuing Obligations:
A Handbook for Companies Listed on Major Stock Exchanges
《履行持续义务：主要证券交易所上市公司手册》
the company. If the NYSE determines that it is inappropriate to provide
the company with the Additional Cure Period, it may commence
suspension and delisting procedures immediately. If a company fails to
file the delinquent report and all subsequent reports by the end of such
Additional Cure Period, the NYSE will commence suspension and
delisting procedures immediately. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
NYSE may take into account the overall circumstances and different
factors and decide at its sole discretion to commence suspension and
delisting procedures at any time from the date of Filing Delinquency. That
is, it may not grant the company an Initial Cure Period or an Additional
Cure Period, or it may early cease the Initial Cure Period or Additional
Cure Period and commence suspension and delisting procedures
immediately.
从逾期申报之日起的六个月（“初始补救期”）内，纽交所将监督公
司以及逾期申报和后续申报的状况，并与该公司联系，直到逾期申
报得到纠正。如果该公司未能在初始补救期内纠正逾期申报，纽交
所可根据该公司的具体情况，自行决定允许该公司的证券在最多六
个月的时间内继续进行交易并继续补救逾期申报的情形（“额外补
救期”）；如纽交所认为不适宜向公司提供额外补救期，也有权立即
开始停牌和除名程序。若公司未能在该额外补救期结束前提交逾期
申报和所有后续申报，纽交所将立即开始停牌和除名程序。尽管有
前述规定，纽交所有权结合各项因素综合判断，自行决定在逾期申
报之日后的任何时间开始停牌和除名程序，即纽交所有权不赋予公
司任何初始补救期或额外补救期或提前停止初始补救期或额外补救
期，并立即开始停牌和除名程序。
Similarly, under the Nasdaq rules, if a foreign private issuer fails to file an
annual report or semi-annual report with the SEC in time, the company
will receive a notice from the Nasdaq Listing Qualifications Department
stating its deficiency (a “Deficiency Notification”). Upon receiving a
Deficiency Notification, in addition to filing with the SEC, the company
is also required to make a press release to disclose its receipt of the
Deficiency Notification and the reasons for the violation. Within 60 days
of the Deficiency Notification (the “Compliance Period”), the company
may submit to the Nasdaq Listing Qualifications Department a plan to
regain compliance which shall state the reasons for the Filing Delinquency,
the likelihood that the filing will be made within the Compliance Period,
etc. If there is a good cause (and the staff may request additional
27
--- Page 36 (Text) ---
Meeting Continuing Obligations:
A Handbook for Companies Listed on Major Stock Exchanges
《履行持续义务：主要证券交易所上市公司手册》
information from the company if necessary), the Nasdaq staff may extend
the foregoing Compliance Period to up to another 15 days, for a total
period of up to 180 days from the due date of the first filing deficiency of
a periodic report (the “Additional Compliance Period”). If the company
does not complete a filing to regain compliance within the Compliance
Period or Additional Compliance Period, the company will receive a
Delisting Determination Letter (“Delisting Letter”) from Nasdaq, stating
that unless the company requests a hearing, it will be delisted on a specific
date. To avoid the delisting, the company may request a hearing with
Nasdaq within 7 days of receiving such Delisting Letter. The Nasdaq
Hearings Panel has the authority to grant extensions of up to 180 days, but
in no event shall the company have more than 360 days from the date of
the first filing deficiency of a periodic report (the “Maximum
Compliance Period”) to file a late report and regain compliance. If the
company fails to complete its filing to regain compliance within the
Maximum Compliance Period, or if the Hearings Panel decides not to
grant the company an extension of the period, the Company will be
suspended and delisted from Nasdaq.
相应地，根据纳斯达克规则，如果外国私人发行人未能按期向 SEC
提交年度报告和半年度报告，将收到纳斯达克上市资格部说明其违
规的通知（“违规通知”）。在收到违规通知后，公司除向 SEC 报告
外，还需要以发布新闻稿的方式公告收到违规通知的情况和违规原
因。公司可在60日内（“合规期限”）向纳斯达克上市资格部提交恢
复合规状态的计划，合规计划应说明逾期申报原因、在合规期限内
申报的可能性等。如有合理理由（且必要时工作人员可要求公司提
供补充信息），工作人员可以将前述合规期限延长至多不超过 15 日，
延长后的总期限最长不超过自首次逾期提交定期报告之日起 180 日
（“额外合规期限”）。如果公司在合规期限或额外合规期限内没有
完成申报恢复合规状态，公司将收到纳斯达克工作人员的退市通知
（“退市通知”），说明如公司不申请听证，则公司将于某个具体日
期退市。为避免退市，公司可以在收到该等退市通知后七日内申请
听证。听证小组有权作出最长不超过 180 日的延期决定，但在任何
情况下，公司提交逾期申报并恢复至合规状态的期限都不能超过自
首次逾期提交定期报告之日起360日（“最长合规期限”）。公司在最
长合规期限内未完成申报恢复合规状态的，或听证小组决定不赋予
公司延长期限的，公司将被纳斯达克停牌和退市。

1.2 Release of financial information
财务信息的发布
1.2.1 Financial statement requirements
财务报表的规定
The financial statements disclosed in annual reports filed in the form of Form
20-F by a China-Based US-Listed Company are subject to audit and must be
signed and certified by the company’s Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) and
Chief Financial Officer (“CFO”), and must be approved by a simple majority
of its board of directors.
中概股上市公司以 20-F 表格形式提交的年度报告所披露的财务报表需经
审计，且必须由公司的首席执行官（Chief Executive Officer，“CEO”）
和首席财务官（Chief Financial Officer，“CFO”）签署认证，并须由董
事会过半数批准通过。
Other quarterly or semi-annual financial information filed in the form of Form
6-K by China-Based US-Listed Companies is not required to be audited, or
signed or certified by the company’s CEO and CFO.
中概股上市公司以 6-K 表格形式提交的其他季度或者半年度财务信息无
需审计，也无需由公司的 CEO及CFO签署认证。
1.2.2 Basic disclosures
基本披露内容
The goal of requiring a foreign private issuer to file Form 20-F is to standardize
the reporting requirements for foreign private issuers so that investors can
evaluate investments in foreign companies alongside the stocks of US domestic
companies. Accordingly, the disclosure content on Form 20-F is very similar to
the content required for US domestic issuers, such as reporting key operational
details, market risks, corporate governance and financial statements, including
the following specific content and requirements of annual financial statements:
要求外国私人发行人申报 20-F 表格的目的是使外国私人发行人的报告要
求标准化，以便投资者能够在评估美国本土企业股票的同时评估对于外
国公司的投资。因此，20-F 表格的披露内容与对美国本土发行人要求的
披露内容非常相似，比如要求报告关键运营细节、市场风险、公司治理
和财务报表等信息，其中年度财务报表的具体内容和要求包括：
(1) financial statements shall be provided for the same fiscal year;
29
--- Page 38 (Text) ---
Meeting Continuing Obligations:
A Handbook for Companies Listed on Major Stock Exchanges
《履行持续义务：主要证券交易所上市公司手册》
应提供相同的财政年度的财务报表；
(2) the content and information disclosed in the financial statements shall be
substantially similar to financial statements that comply with US GAAP
and SEC Regulation S-X (“Regulation S-X”);
财务报表披露的信息内容应与符合 US GAAP 和美国证券交易委员
会 S-X条例（SEC Regulation S-X，“S-X条例”）的财务报表实质上
相似；
(3) financial statements and schedules may be prepared in accordance with
US GAAP, International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”) or local
generally accepted accounting principles. If the financial statements adopt
IFRS, a clear and unqualified statement on the compliance with IFRS
must be included in the notes to the financial statements, and the audit
report must express an opinion that the financial statements comply with
IFRS. If the financial statements and schedules are prepared in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles other than US GAAP or
IFRS, the applicable accounting principle must be disclosed in the
accountant’s report or financial statements which shall illustrate the
material differences between such accounting principle and US GAAP
and Regulation S-X.
财务报表和附表可以根据 US GAAP、国际财务报告准则
（International Financial Reporting Standards，“IFRS”）或当地公
认会计准则编制。如果财务报表采用的是IFRS，则财务报表的注释
中必须发表关于遵守 IFRS 的明确且不作保留的说明，且审计报告
中必须发表该等财务报表遵守 IFRS 的意见。如果财务报表和附表
是按照除 US GAAP或IFRS以外的其他公认会计准则编制的，则必
须在会计师报告或财务报表中披露适用的准则，并且必须讨论其与
US GAAP和S-X条例的重大差异。
China-Based US-Listed Companies listed on the NYSE and Nasdaq, as foreign
private issuers, shall disclose their semi-annual financial information on Form
6-K, which shall contain specific content including an interim balance sheet as
of the end of the second fiscal quarter, as well as a semi-annual income
statement covering the first two fiscal quarters. Such unaudited financial
information is not required to be reconciled to US GAAP.
在纽交所和纳斯达克上市的中概股上市公司作为外国私人发行人应在 6-
K 表格中披露其半年度财务信息，具体内容包括截至第二财政季度末的
30
--- Page 39 (Text) ---
Meeting Continuing Obligations:

《履行持续义务：主要证券交易所上市公司手册》
中期资产负债表，以及涵盖其前两个财政季度的半年度损益表。该等未
经审计的财务信息无需与 US GAAP进行核对。
1.2.3 Other key disclosure requirements
其他主要披露要求
In addition to financial statements, annual reports that a China-Based US-Listed
Company is required to file in the form of Form 20-F are required to disclose
the following key information:
除财务报表外，中概股上市公司须以 20-F 表格的形式提交的年度报告还
需披露以下主要信息：
(1) a description of the issuer’s business;
发行人的业务描述；
(2) selected financial information;
选定的财务信息；
(3) discussion of significant risk factors;
重大风险因素的讨论；
(4) a summary of material legal proceedings;
重大法律诉讼的摘要；
(5) management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results
of operations (“MD&A”); and
管理层对财务状况和经营成果的讨论和分析（“MD&A”）；以及
(6) information about the issuer’s directors, senior officers and employees,
including certain disclosures regarding its senior officers’ compensation
and share ownership.
有关发行人董事、高级管理层和雇员的信息，包括有关高级管理人
员薪酬和股份所有权的某些披露。
Notably, the MD&A is a narrative explanation of the company’s financial
statements and accompanying notes, and the senior officers use the MD&A to
inform investors of their views on the company’s financial performance and
condition and to provide investors with information not shown in the financial
statements, as well as trends and risks that have contributed to the company’s
current state of affairs or that could reasonably affect the company’s future
31

Meeting Continuing Obligations:

performance. As a result, the SEC generally strictly scrutinizes the disclosures
in the MD&A section.
值得注意的是，由于 MD&A是对公司财务报表和所附脚注的叙述性解释，
且管理层通过 MD&A告知投资者其对公司财务业绩和状况的看法，并向
投资者提供财务报表中未显示的信息以及导致公司现状或可能合理影响
公司未来业绩的趋势和风险，因此 SEC 对于该部分的披露一般均将进行
严格审查。
1.3 Summary
总结
This Section provides an overview of the key disclosure requirements of
financial information under the US Securities Exchange Act and the NYSE and
Nasdaq listing rules. As a foreign private issuer, a China-Based US-Listed
Company must refer to the disclosure requirements of Form 20-F and the
relevant SEC rules when preparing financial information.
本节概述了《美国证券交易法》、纽交所和纳斯达克上市规则的主要财务
信息披露要求。中概股上市公司作为外国私人发行人在编制财务信息时，

1.2 Catalist board
凯利板
According to the SGX Rulebooks - Catalist Rules (“Catalist Board Rules”),
companies listed on SGX RegCo’s Catalist Board (“Catalist Board listed
companies”) are required to regularly publish financial information every year,
including annual reports and interim reports (quarterly or semi-annually, as the
case may be). The publication periods, preparation requirements and content
requirements of financial information of Catalist Board listed companies are
largely similar to SGX Main Board listed companies, except that the location of
the provisions is different. Among them, the financial information of Catalist
Board listed companies must be prepared in accordance with Appendix 7C of
the Catalist Board Rules.
根据《新加坡交易所规则手册——凯利板规则》（“凯利板规则”），新加
坡凯利板上市公司（“凯利板上市公司”）每年须定期发布财务信息，包
括年度报告、中期报告（每季度或每半年一次，视情况而定）。凯利板上
市公司财务信息的发布期限、编制要求及内容要求与主板上市公司大致
相似，只是条文的位置不同。其中，凯利板上市公司财务信息必须按照
凯利板规则附录 7C进行编制。
In terms of specific industry requirements, Catalist Board only targets mineral,
oil and gas companies listed on Catalist Board (pre-profit life science companies
are only given preferential listing conditions on Main Board). In addition to the
same disclosure requirements as for mineral, oil and gas companies under the
SGX Main Board Rules, Rule 705(6) of the Catalist Board Rules also
specifically provides that for mineral, oil and gas companies whose principal
activities include the exploration of minerals, oil or natural gas, the use of
funds/cash and forecasts must be confirmed by its directors confirming that, to
the best of the directors’ knowledge, no such information has been found to be
false or misleading in any material respect, but the directors are not required to
commission an external audit or review of the statements. The confirmation
letter can be signed by two directors on behalf of the board of directors.

在特定行业要求方面，凯利板仅针对在凯利板上市的矿产、石油及天然
气公司（未盈利生命科学公司仅在主板给予优惠上市条件）。除与主板规
则中的矿产、石油及天然气公司相同的披露要求外，凯利板规则第 705
（6）条还特别规定，主要活动包括勘探矿产、石油或天然气的矿产、石
油和天然气公司必须由其董事确认对其资金/现金的使用和预测，确认据
董事所知，没有发现任何此类信息在任何重大方面具有虚假或误导性，
但不要求董事们委托对报表进行外部审计或审查。确认书可由 2 名董事
代表董事会签署。
1.3 Consequences of failure to disclose financial information in time
未按期披露财务信息的后果
A breach of the disclosure rules for listed companies may be deemed to be a
contravention of Section 203 of Singapore’s Securities and Futures Act 2001
(“Singapore Securities and Futures Act”). Under Section 204, contravention
of the disclosure rules may result in a fine of up to S$250,000 or an
imprisonment term of up to 7 years.
违反上市公司披露规则可能被视为违反新加坡《2001 年证券及期货法》
（“《证券及期货法》”）第 203 条的规定。根据第 204 节的规定，违
反披露规则可能会被处以最高 25万新币的罚款或最高 7年的监禁。
Under Section 46 of the Singapore Securities and Futures Act, the government
has broad powers to direct SGX RegCo to take certain actions, such as suspend
trading.
根据《证券及期货法》第 46 条，政府拥有广泛的权力来指示新交所采取

日距离评估报告使用日不得超过一年。沪深主板规定，中国证监会、各
交易所根据审慎原则要求，公司依据其章程或其他法律法规等规定，以
及公司自愿提交股东大会审议的交易事项，应当适用前述规定。
In addition, the Shanghai and Shenzhen Main Boards specifically require that
when a transaction of an A-share listed company reaches the major transaction
disclosure standards applicable to that board, and the counterparty uses non-
cash assets as transaction consideration or to offset the debts of the A-share
listed company, the A-share listed company shall also disclose the audit report
or appraisal report of the non-cash assets involved in accordance with the
foregoing provisions in compliance with the standards. If the transaction of a
53

《履行持续义务：主要证券交易所上市公司手册》
company listed on the Shenzhen Main Board reaches the standard that should
be submitted to the shareholders’ general meeting for approval, the company
shall also disclose the relevant audit report or appraisal report in accordance
with the aforesaid provisions.
此外，沪深主板特别规定，当 A 股上市公司发生交易达到该板块适用的
重大交易披露标准，且交易对方以非现金资产作为交易对价或者抵偿 A
股上市公司债务的，A 股上市公司亦应当按照前述规定披露所涉及非现
金资产的符合标准的审计报告或评估报告。深交所主板上市公司交易达
到应当提交股东大会审议标准的，同样需按照前述规定披露相关审计或
评估报告。
Except for the Shanghai Main Board, all other boards require that the audit
report or appraisal report of the target must be provided, that is, although the
transaction does not meet the standards that should be submitted to the
shareholders’ meeting for approval, the SSE and the SZSE (pursuant to the
listing rules of the Shenzhen Main Board, including the CSRC) deem necessary,
the A-share listed company shall provide audit report or appraisal report on the
object.
除上交所主板外，其他各板块均规定了应当提供标的资产审计或者评估
报告的兜底情形，即交易虽未达到应当提交股东大会审议标准的，但是
上交所、深交所（深交所主板上市规则还包括中国证监会）认为有必要
的，A股上市公司应当提供标的资产的审计或者评估报告。
The Shanghai and Shenzhen Main Boards specifically require that if an A-share
listed company purchases or sells a minority interest in the transaction target,
and if the A-share listed company is indeed unable to audit the financial
accounting report of the transaction target for the most recent one-year and one-
period because of objective reasons such as the A-share listed company is
unable to form control, joint control or significant influence over the transaction
target before or after the transaction, it is exempted from disclosure of the
auditor’s report in accordance with the relevant regulations after disclosure of
the relevant information, except for those cases where otherwise stipulated by
the CSRC or the A-share Exchanges.
沪深主板特别规定，A 股上市公司购买或出售交易标的少数股权，因 A
股上市公司在交易前后均无法对交易标的形成控制、共同控制或重大影
响等客观原因，导致确实无法对交易标的最近一年又一期财务会计报告

approval and disclosure requirements for notifiable transactions
上市公司交易事项的批准及披露要求：须予公布的交易批准及披露要求
Hong Kong listed companies are required to approve and disclose any notifiable
transactions in accordance with Chapter 14 of the Hong Kong Listing Rules.
香港上市公司须按照香港上市规则第十四章的规定来批准及披露任何须
予公布的交易。
1.1 What is a notifiable transaction?
什么是须予公布的交易？
For the purpose of Chapter 14 of the Hong Kong Listing Rules, “transactions”
carried out by a Hong Kong listed company include, without limitation, the
following types of, among others, arrangement or agreement: (i) acquisition or
disposal of assets, (ii) entering into or terminating finance leases (where such
leases have a financial impact on the balance sheet and/or profit and loss account
of the Hong Kong listed company), (iii) grant of indemnities, guarantees or
provision of financial assistance, (iv) entering into or terminating operating
leases (where such leases are due to their size, nature or number have a
significant impact on the business operations of the Hong Kong listed
company).10
就香港上市规则第十四章而言，香港上市公司进行的“交易”包括但不
限于以下各类安排或协议：（i）收购或出售资产、（ii）订立或终止融资
租赁（而该等租赁对香港上市公司的资产负债表及/或损益账具有财务影
响）、（iii）作出赔偿保证、担保或提供财务资助、（iv）订立或终止营业
租赁（而该等租赁由于规模、性质或数目的关系，对香港上市公司的经
营运作具有重大影响）。10
Whether a transaction is required to be announced depends on its size, and the
size of a transaction must be assessed using the following five types of tests (the
“transaction size test”) (see Rule 14.07 of the Hong Kong Listing Rules for
10 For details, please refer to Rule 14.04(1) of the Hong Kong Listing Rules for the complete definition

details):
一项交易是否须予公布取决于其规模，而一项交易的规模须用以下五类
测试来评估（“交易规模测试”）（详见香港上市规则第14.07条）：
(1) Assets ratio: the total assets involved in the relevant transaction divided
by the total assets of the Hong Kong listed company;
资产比率：有关交易所涉及的资产总值，除以香港上市公司的资产
总值；
(2) Profits ratio: the profit attributable to the assets involved in the relevant
transaction divided by the profit of the Hong Kong listed company;
盈利比率：有关交易所涉及资产应占的盈利，除以香港上市公司的
盈利；
(3) Revenue ratio: the revenue attributable to the assets involved in the
relevant transaction divided by the revenue of the Hong Kong listed
company;
收益比率：有关交易所涉及资产应占的收益，除以香港上市公司的
收益；
(4) Consideration ratio: the relevant consideration divided by the total market
capitalization of the Hong Kong listed company. The total market
capitalization is the average closing price of securities of the Hong Kong
listed company as stated in the daily quotations sheets of the Hong Kong
Stock Exchange for the five business days preceding the relevant
transaction date; and
代价比率：有关代价除以香港上市公司的市值总额。市值总额为香
港联交所日报表所载香港上市公司证券于有关交易日期之前五个营
业日的平均收市价；及
(5) Equity capital ratio: the number of shares issued by the Hong Kong listed
company as consideration divided by the total number of issued shares of
the Hong Kong listed company before the relevant transaction.
股本比率：香港上市公司发行作为代价的股份数目，除以进行有关
交易前香港上市公司已发行股份总数。
Hong Kong listed companies must determine the type of transaction based on
the ratio derived from the above transaction size test and refer to the following
table (set out in Rule 14.08 of the Hong Kong Listing Rules) to comply with the

1.2.1 Provisions on aggregation of transactions
将交易合并计算的相关规定
According to Rule 14.22 of the Hong Kong Listing Rules, the Hong Kong Stock
Exchange may require the Hong Kong listed company to aggregate a series of
transactions and treat them as if they were one transaction if they are all
completed within a 12-month period or are otherwise related. In such cases, the
70
--- Page 79 (Text) ---
Meeting Continuing Obligations:
A Handbook for Companies Listed on Major Stock Exchanges
《履行持续义务：主要证券交易所上市公司手册》
Hong Kong listed company must comply with the requirements for the relevant
classification of the transaction when aggregated and the figures to be used for
determining the percentage ratios.
根据香港上市规则第 14.22 条，如一连串交易全部均于 12 个月内完成或
属彼此相关者，香港联交所或会要求香港上市公司，将该等交易合并计
算，作为一项交易处理。在这些情况下，香港上市公司须遵守该项合计
后的交易所属类别之有关规定，以厘定有关百分比率的数字。
According to Rule 14.23 of the Hong Kong Listing Rules, in considering
whether transactions will be aggregated, the following factors would be taken
into account: (1) whether the transactions are entered into by the Hong Kong
listed company with the same party or with parties connected or otherwise
associated with one another; (2) whether the transactions involve the acquisition
or disposal of securities or an interest in one particular company or group of
companies; (3) whether the transactions involve the acquisition or disposal of
parts of one asset; or (4) the series of transactions altogether would lead to
substantial involvement by the Hong Kong listed company in a business activity
which does not previously form part of the Hong Kong listed company’s
principal business activities.
根据香港上市规则第14.23条，香港联交所在考虑应否将交易合并计算时
将考虑的因素包括：（1）是否为香港上市公司与同一方所进行的交易，
或与互相有关连或其他联系的人士所进行的交易；（2）交易是否涉及收
购或出售某一特定公司或集团公司的证券或权益；（3）交易是否涉及收
购或出售一项资产的组成部分；或（4）该等交易共同导致香港上市公司
大量参与一项业务，而该业务以往并不属于香港上市公司主要业务的一
部分。
According to the listing decisions issued by the Hong Kong Stock Exchange
regarding Rule 14.22 of the Hong Kong Listing Rules, the purpose of
aggregation is to prevent a Hong Kong listed company from “splitting” an
otherwise large transaction into two or more smaller transactions so that, when
size tests are applied to each smaller transaction, it does not reach the relevant
thresholds for requiring disclosure and/or shareholders’ approval. The above list
of factors which the Hong Kong Stock Exchange will take into account when
determining the applicability of the aggregation rules are not exhaustive. The
relevant rule intends to provide guidance on the circumstances where the Hong
Kong Stock Exchange may require aggregation of transactions of a Hong Kong
listed company. When determining whether aggregation of transactions is
71
--- Page 80 (Text) ---
Meeting Continuing Obligations:
A Handbook for Companies Listed on Major Stock Exchanges
《履行持续义务：主要证券交易所上市公司手册》
required in a particular case, the Hong Kong Stock Exchange will consider all
relevant facts and circumstances of the case.
根据香港联交所出具有关香港上市规则第14.22条的上市决策，合并计算
的目的是防止香港上市公司将大宗交易“拆细”为两宗或以上规模较小
的交易，令以每宗规模较小的交易进行规模测试时，可避免触及有关须
予披露及/或股东批准的水平。上述香港联交所在决定有关合并计算规则
是否适用时所考虑的因素并非详尽无遗。有关规则旨在给予指引，说明
香港联交所可能要求香港上市公司将交易合并计算的情况。在决定某个
案的交易是否须合并计算时，香港联交所将会考虑该个案的所有有关事
实及情况。
1.2.2 Timing requirements for announcements
公告的时间要求
According to Rule 14.37 of the Hong Kong Listing Rules, a Hong Kong listed
company is required to ensure the confidentiality of information until an
announcement is made in accordance with the Inside Information Provisions
(see below (Part I: Composition and Disclosure of Inside Information – Hong
Kong) for more details) when it reasonably believes that the material terms of
the transaction agreement have been finalized.
根据香港上市规则第14.37条，香港上市公司在合理相信交易协议的主要
条款已经确定后，须确保有关资料保密直至根据内幕消息条文（详见下
文（第一部分：内幕消息的构成及披露–港股））刊发公告。
If a Hong Kong listed company considers that the confidentiality of the
information cannot be maintained or that it may have already been leaked, it
must make an announcement or immediately apply for a temporary trading
suspension or a trading halt.
如香港上市公司认为消息不能维持保密，或者可能已经外泄，须发出公
告或立刻申请短暂停牌或停牌。
1.2.3 Content requirements for announcements
公告的内容要求
Rule 14.58 of the Hong Kong Listing Rules sets out the general requirements
for the content of announcements of notifiable transactions, including but not

nature of the transaction (amount and details of securities, if applicable), (ii) the

总结
In simple terms, Hong Kong listed companies are required to notify the Hong
Kong Stock Exchange and publish an announcement in relation to the
transaction when they enter into the above notifiable transactions. However,
Hong Kong listed companies are generally not required to circulate circulars to
their shareholders, obtain shareholders’ approval of the transaction or prepare
an accountants’ report if the percentage ratio of the size tests for the transaction
is less than 25%. If one or more of the percentage ratio(s) of the transaction size
test reaches 25% or more, the Hong Kong Stock Exchange will require the
77

shareholders of the Hong Kong listed company to approve the transaction and,
in some cases, to prepare an accountants’ report.
简单而言，香港上市公司进行上述须予公布的交易时，均需要通知香港
联交所及发布关于交易的公告，但如果相关交易的各类交易规模测试比
率低于 25%，香港上市公司一般不需要向其股东传阅通函、获取股东对
交易的批准或准备会计师报告。如果有一类或多类交易规模测试比率达
到 25%或以上，香港联交所会要求香港上市公司的股东批准该交易，以
及在一些情况下准备会计师报告。

required to fulfill their real-time reporting obligations (Current Report)
stipulated in the US Securities Exchange Act, through Form 6-K. China-Based
US-Listed Companies must disclose the following material information in Form

根据《美国证券交易法》13a-16 规则及 15d-16 规则的要求，中概股上市

In practice, we have noted certain situations in which a China-Based US-Listed
Company is subject to current report obligations through Form 6-K, including
but not limited to: (i) issuance of securities elsewhere than in the US (e.g., listing
of a China-Based US-Listed Company on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange); (ii)
privatization offers to a China-Based US-Listed Company made by directors
and senior officers, etc.; (iii) issuance of bonds; (iv) large amount financial fraud;
(v) advice by the auditor that the auditor’s opinion for a certain period shall not
be relied upon; and (vi) signing of a large amount settlement agreement.
实践中，我们注意到中概股上市公司需要通过 6-K 表格履行实时报告义
务的情形包括但不限于：（i）在除了美国以外的其他地方发行证券（如
中概股上市公司在香港联交所上市）；（ii）董事和高级管理人员等对中概
股上市公司发出私有化邀约；（iii）发行债券；（iv）存在较大金额流水造
假；（v）审计师告知某段时期的审计意见不可依赖；（vi）签署大额和解
协议等。
1.2 Disclosure of material matters
重大事项披露内容
The matters required to be disclosed in Form 6-K shall be material. There is no
clear written standard for materiality, but it is determined based on the basic
“materiality” standard of the US securities laws and regulations, that is, from
the perspective of a rational investor, whether the disclosure of such
circumstances is material to the investor’s decision to buy or sell securities.
There is also an interaction between materiality and probability, that is, when
judging whether a certain matter needs to be disclosed, the higher the materiality
of the matter, the lower the probability of its occurrence is required. Matters
generally required to be disclosed include:
6-K表格要求所披露的事项应为重要（Material）的。重要性（Materiality）
并没有明确的成文标准，而是基于美国证券法律规则中基本的“重要性”
标准进行判断，即从理性的投资者看来，披露该等情况对投资者买卖证
券的决定而言是否重要。重要性和可能性之间也存在着相互作用，即在
判断某事项是否需要被披露时，该事项的重要性程度越高，则对其发生
概率的要求就越低。一般需予披露的事项包括：
(1) changes in business operation;
业务变化；
(2) changes in management or control;
80
--- Page 89 (Text) ---

管理层或控制权的变化；

(5) changes in the certified accountant engaged by the issuer;
发行人所聘用的注册会计师发生变化；

falls into the above categories depends on the size of the relative figures
computed on the following basis:
主板规则第 1006 条规定，判断一项交易是否属于以上类别的交易，需要

(1) Asset ratio: the net asset value of the assets to be disposed of, compared
with the group’s net asset value. This basis is not applicable to an
acquisition of assets.

础不适用于资产收购。

the Exchange may permit valuations to be used instead of volume or
amount.

下：
(1) For related party transactions, disclosure is required regarding the nature
and extent of any transactions or presently proposed transactions that are
material to the China-Based US-Listed Company or its related parties, or
any transactions that are unusual in their nature or conditions, involving
goods, services, or tangible or intangible assets, to which the China-Based
US-Listed Company or any of its parent company or subsidiaries is a party.
对于关联交易，需要披露对中概股上市公司或关联方具有重要性的
任何交易或目前拟进行的交易的性质和程度，或中概股上市公司、
其母公司或其任何子公司作为一方的涉及货物、服务、有形或无形

(2) For related party loans, disclosure is required regarding the amount of
outstanding loans (including guarantees of any kind) made by the China-
Based US-Listed Company, its parent company or any of its subsidiaries
to or for the benefit of any of the related parties listed above. The
information given should include the largest amount outstanding during
the period covered, the amount outstanding as of the latest practicable date,
the nature of the loan and the transaction in which it is incurred, and the
interest rate on the loan. In addition, if the China-Based US-Listed
Company, its parent company, or any of its subsidiaries is a foreign bank
(a bank not registered in the US) that has made a loan to which item (3)
below does not apply, it is necessary to identify the director, senior
management member, or other related party who received the loan, and
165

《履行持续义务：主要证券交易所上市公司手册》
describe the nature of the loan recipient’s relationship to the foreign bank.

司向任何关联方提供的或为任何关联方的利益提供的尚未偿还的贷
款（包括任何种类的担保）金额。所提供的信息应包括所涉期间的
最高未偿贷款金额、截至最后实际可行日期的未偿金额、贷款的性
质、引发贷款发生的交易以及贷款的利率。此外，如果该中概股上
市公司、其母公司或其任何子公司是一家非在美国注册设立的外国
银行，并提供了不适用下述第（3）项的贷款，需要指明接受贷款
的董事、高级管理人员或其他关联方，并描述贷款接受方与该外国
银行的关系；
(3) With respect to item (2) above, if the lender is a bank, savings and loan
association, or broker-dealer extending credit under Federal Reserve
Regulation T, and the loans are not disclosed as past due, nonaccrual or
troubled debt restructurings in the consolidated financial statements, such
related party transaction disclosures may include a statement, if true, that
the loans in question (a) are made in the ordinary course of business; (b)
are made on substantially the same terms, including interest rates and
collateral, as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with
other persons, and (c) do not involve more than the normal risk of
collectability or present other unfavorable features.
针对前述第（2）项，如果贷款人是一家银行、储蓄贷款机构或根
据《联邦储备委员会T条例》（Federal Reserve Regulation T）发放信
贷的经纪交易商，且该贷款在合并财务报表中并非被披露为逾期未
付、未经计提或困境债务重组，则该等关联交易披露可包含一项声
明（如属实），即相关贷款（a）是在正常业务过程中提供的，（b）
其条款与当时可与第三方进行的类似交易中市场通行的条款（包括
利率和抵押品）实质一致，及（c）不涉及超出正常范围的可获得
清偿风险，也未显示其他不利特征；
(4) In respect of item (2) above, if the China-Based US-Listed Company
cannot state that the foregoing item (3) does not apply to the recipient of
a foreign bank loan (since the China Company has concluded that such
disclosure would conflict with the privacy laws (such as customer
confidentiality and data protection laws) of China), the China-Based US-
Listed Company must provide a legal opinion attesting to that conclusion
as an exhibit, as well as disclosing and/or stating that: (a) an unnamed
director, senior management member, or other related party for which
166
--- Page 175 (Text) ---
Meeting Continuing Obligations:
A Handbook for Companies Listed on Major Stock Exchanges
《履行持续义务：主要证券交易所上市公司手册》
disclosure is required by this item, has been the recipient of a loan to
which item (3) above does not apply; (b) the privacy laws of the
Company’s home jurisdiction prevent the disclosure of the name of the
loan recipient; and (c) the loan recipient is unable to waive or has
otherwise not waived the application of such privacy laws.
针对前述第（2）项，如果中概股上市公司无法指明不适用前述第
（3）项的外国银行贷款的接受方（例如，若因为中概股上市公司
认定披露该等信息将与中概股上市公司所在司法辖区的隐私法律
（例如客户保密法和数据保护法）相冲突），则中概股上市公司必
须就此提供一份法律意见书作为附件，同时还必须披露并/或声明：
（a）本条款中要求披露但未透露姓名的董事、高级管理人员或其
他关联方是不适用前述第（3）项的贷款的接受方；（b）中概股上
市公司所在司法辖区的隐私法禁止披露该贷款接受方的姓名；以及
（c）该贷款接受方无法或尚未就该等隐私法的适用获得豁免；
(5) If the related party transaction involves the recovery of excess
share/employee incentive-based compensation as disclosed pursuant to
Item 6.F of Form 20-F, then a disclosure under Item 7.B is not required.
如果关联交易涉及根据20-F表格第6.F条披露的获取基于股权/员工
激励的超额报酬，则无需根据第 7.B条进行披露。

新加坡
1. Connected transaction approval and disclosure requirements
关连交易 (Connected Transaction)批准及披露要求
In Singapore, connected transactions are separately referred to as interested
person transactions (“Interested Person Transactions”) and related party
transactions (“Related Party Transactions”). Among them, Interested Person
Transactions are stipulated in Chapter 9 “Interested Person Transactions” of
both the SGX Main Board Rules and the Catalist Board Rules. The purpose is
to guard against the risk that interested persons could influence the listed
company, its subsidiaries or associated companies to enter into transactions with
interested persons that may adversely affect the interests of the listed company
or its shareholders. Related Party Transactions are regulated by accounting
standards, specifically stipulated in the Singapore Financial Reporting Standard
24 (“FRS 24”), which may be applied by listed companies and non-listed
companies. As an accounting standard, FRS 24 focuses on requiring companies
to disclose Related Party Transactions in their regular financial statements. FRS
24 does not explicitly require Related Party Transactions to be reviewed to
ensure they are independent. Rather, the obligation to review and approve
Related Party Transactions is driven by corporate governance requirements and
practices and company law.
在新加坡，关连交易被分别称作利害关系人交易（Interested Person
Transactions，以下称“利害关系人交易”）和关联方交易（Related Party
Transactions，以下称“关联方交易”）。其中，利害关系人交易被同时规
定在主板和凯利板上市规则的第 9 章“利害关系人交易”一章中，目的
是防范利害关系人可能影响上市公司、其子公司或联营公司进行交易，
从而对公司或其股东的利益造成不利影响的风险；关联方交易被规定在
会计准则中，具体是在新加坡财务报告准则第 24 号文件（the Singapore
Financial Reporting Standard 24，“FRS24”）中，适用于上市公司和非上市
公司。作为一项会计准则，FRS24 侧重于让公司在定期财务报表中披露
关联方交易。FRS24 并没有明确规定有必要审查关联交易，以确保它们
是独立的。相反，审查和批准关联方交易的责任是由公司治理要求和实
践以及公司法驱动的。

1. The composition and disclosure of inside information
内幕消息的构成及披露
1.1 Disclosure of price-sensitive information
披露股价敏感资料
With effect from 1 January 2013, Part XIVA of the Securities and Futures
Ordinance (Cap. 571 of the laws of Hong Kong) (the “SFO”) regulates the
disclosure of price-sensitive information by listed companies in Hong Kong
(referred to as “inside information” in the SFO. To this end, the Securities and
Futures Commission of Hong Kong (“SFC”) has issued the “Guidelines on the
Disclosure of Inside Information” (the “SFC Inside Information Guidelines”)
to assist Hong Kong listed companies in complying with the obligation to
disclose inside information.
自2013年1月1日起，《证券及期货条例》（香港法例第571章）（“《证
券及期货条例》”）第 XIVA 部是规管香港上市公司披露股价敏感资料“
（《“证券及期货条例》中称为“内幕消息”）的相关法例。为此，香港证
券及期货事务监察委员会（“香港证监会”）发布《内幕消息披露指引》“
（“香港证监会《指引》”）协助香港上市公司遵守披露内幕消息的责
任。
This system creates a statutory obligation for Hong Kong listed companies to
disclose inside information to the public as soon as reasonably practicable after
becoming aware of such inside information.
该制度创立了香港上市公司在知悉内幕消息后，须在合理地切实可行的
范围内尽快向公众披露该等内幕消息的法定责任。
1.2 What constitutes inside information
内幕消息的构成
According to Section 307A of the SFO, for a Hong Kong listed company,
“inside information” means specific news or information that meets the
following description:
根据《证券及期货条例》第307A条，就某香港上市公司而言，“内幕消
息”指符合以下说明的具体消息或资料：
200
--- Page 209 (Text) ---
Meeting Continuing Obligations:

《履行持续义务：主要证券交易所上市公司手册》
(1) about:
关于：
(a) the Hong Kong listed company;
该香港上市公司的；
(b) a shareholder or officer of the Hong Kong listed company; or
该香港上市公司的股东或高级人员的；或
(c) the listed securities of the Hong Kong listed company or derivatives
of those securities; and
该香港上市公司的上市证券的或该等证券的衍生工具；及
(2) it is not generally known to persons who are accustomed to (or are likely
to) deal in the listed securities of the Hong Kong listed company, but such
news or information, if generally known to them, is likely to have a
significant impact on the price of such securities.
并非普遍为惯常（或相当可能会）进行该香港上市公司的上市证券
交易的人所知，但该等消息或资料如普遍为他们所知，则相当可能
会对该等证券的价格造成重大影响。
The “inside information” that Hong Kong listed companies are required to
disclose is the same as the definition of “relevant information” specified in Part
XIII of the SFO regarding the anti-insider trading system.
香港上市公司须披露的“内幕消息”与《证券及期货条例》第 XIII 部涉
及打击内幕交易制度规定的“有关消息”定义相同。
1.2.1 Main elements of inside information
内幕消息的主要元素
(1) The news or information must be specific;
消息或资料必须具体；
(2) the news or information must not be generally known to those in the
market in which transactions in the company’s listed securities are (or are
likely to be) carried out; and
该等消息或资料必须并非普遍为进行（或相当可能会进行）该公司
上市证券交易的市场界别所知；及
201
--- Page 210 (Text) ---
Meeting Continuing Obligations:
A Handbook for Companies Listed on Major Stock Exchanges
《履行持续义务：主要证券交易所上市公司手册》
(3) if such news or information is generally known to them, it is likely to
have a significant impact on the price of the company’s securities.
该等消息或资料如普遍为他们所知，则相当可能会对该公司证券的
价格造成重大影响。
1.2.2 Specificity of information
消息的具体性
Specific news or information generally have the following characteristics:
具体消息或资料一般具备以下特征：
(1) Such news or information can be identified, defined and expressed in an
unambiguous manner.
该等消息或资料可予以识别、界定及以毫不含糊的方式表达。
The news or information about the affairs of a Hong Kong listed company
is sufficiently specific if it contains details of a transaction, event or matter,
or details of a proposed transaction, event or matter, capable of being
identified, described in a coherent manner and its nature being understood.
关于香港上市公司事务的消息或资料如已包含某项交易、事件或事
宜的细节，或建议交易、事件或事宜的细节，将该交易、事件或事
宜识别出来，并以条理清楚的方式描述及使人了解其性质，即属充
分具体。
(2) Such news or information does not need to be precise.
该等消息或资料不需是精确的。
The transaction, event or matter which does not contain precise exact
details or particulars can still be considered specific. For example, if a
Hong Kong listed company is facing a financial crisis or is considering
placing shares, even if the details are not known, it will still be regarded
as specific news.
该交易、事件或事宜无需包含精准确切的细节或详情，仍可被视作
具体。例如，某香港上市公司正面对财政危机，或正考虑配售股份，
即使详情并未知悉，仍会被视为具体消息。
However, mere rumors, vague hopes and worries, and unsubstantiated
conjecture are not specific news or information.
202

Meeting Continuing Obligations:
A Handbook for Companies Listed on Major Stock Exchanges
《履行持续义务：主要证券交易所上市公司手册》
然而，纯属谣传、不明确的希望及忧虑，以及无凭据的臆测不是具
体消息或资料。
(3) News or information about a transaction contemplated or negotiated (and
for which a final agreement (formal or informal) has not yet been reached)
may be specific.
正在考虑进行或商议中的交易（及仍未达成最终协议（正式或非正
式的））的消息或资料可属具体消息或资料。
A proposal should go beyond a vague exchange of ideas or a “fishing
expedition”, otherwise it cannot constitute specific news or information.
If negotiations or contacts have occurred, the negotiations should
generally reflect the actual business situation, that is, all parties involved
intend to negotiate with a realistic view to achieving an identifiable goal.
Otherwise, they cannot be regarded as specific news or information.
某项建议应超越不明确的交换意见或渔翁撒网式的打探阶段，否则
不能构成具体消息或资料。如已展开商议或接触，该等商议应大体
上反映商业实况，即各参与方均有意怀着切实可行的想法，为达成
可识别的目标进行商议，否则不能被视为具体消息或资料。
1.2.3 “Not generally known”
“并非普遍为人所知”
The essence of inside information is news or information known only to a few
people and not generally known to the market, which is defined as those who
are accustomed to (or are likely to) trade in the company’s listed securities. The
group or category of investors who are accustomed to (or are likely to) trade the
company’s listed securities may be large, covering not only professional traders
and investors with extensive information collection networks, but also part of
the investing public, including the retail investors who deals in a particular
category of stocks (to which the securities of the company belong).
内幕消息的本质是仅为少数人所知，及并非普遍为市场所知的消息或资
料，而市场则被界定为惯常（或相当可能会）进行该公司上市证券交易
的人。惯常（或相当可能会）进行该公司上市证券交易的投资者群组或
类别可能很大，不但涵盖具备广泛资料搜集网络的专业交易人员及投资
者，亦涵盖部分投资大众，包括买卖特定类别股票（而该公司属于该类
别）的散户投资者。

《履行持续义务：主要证券交易所上市公司手册》
Rumors, media speculation or market expectations regarding events or
circumstances of a Hong Kong listed company do not mean that such news or
information is generally known to the market. The exact facts that are actually
known to the market after being properly disclosed by Hong Kong listed
companies cannot be confused with events or circumstances that are speculated
or expected to happen and need to be confirmed should be distinguished.
有关某香港上市公司事件或情况的谣传、传媒揣测或市场期望不等于该
等消息或资料已普遍为市场所知。经香港上市公司妥善披露后为市场实
际知道的确切事实，与揣测或期望可能发生并有待证实的事件或情况，
两者不可混为一谈。
When Hong Kong listed companies determine whether the news or information
is generally known as a result of media commentary, coverage in analyst reports
or reports by news service providers, they should consider not only the extent
to which the news or information has been disseminated, but the accuracy and
completeness of the news or information disseminated and the reliance that the
market can place on such news or information. If the news or information known
to the market is incomplete or has major omissions or there are doubts as to its
bona fides, the news or information will not be regarded as generally known and
the Hong Kong listed company must make full disclosure.
香港上市公司在决定某项消息或资料是否因传媒评论、分析员报告或新
闻服务提供者报道而属普遍为人所知时，不但应考虑散发该消息或资料
的广泛程度，还应考虑散发的消息或资料是否准确及完整，以及市场可
倚赖该消息或资料的程度。若市场所知的消息或资料并不完整或有重大
遗漏或其真诚程度受到质疑，该消息或资料将不能视作普遍为人所知，
而该香港上市公司必须作出全面披露。
For further explanation on how Hong Kong listed companies should respond to
media speculation, market rumors and analyst reports, see Part V Listed
Companies’ Communication with the Public and Publicity Restrictions – Hong
Kong below.
有关香港上市公司应如何应对传媒揣测、市场谣传及分析员报告的进一
步解述，见下文第五部分（上市公司与公众的交流及宣传限制 – 港股）。
1.2.4 “Is likely to have a material effect on the price of listed securities”
“可能会对上市证券的价格造成重大影响”
When judging whether inside information will have a material effect on the
price, it must be based on whether the news or information will affect the
204
--- Page 213 (Text) ---
Meeting Continuing Obligations:
A Handbook for Companies Listed on Major Stock Exchanges
《履行持续义务：主要证券交易所上市公司手册》
decision of a person who is accustomed to (or is likely to) trade in the shares to
decide whether to buy or sell the shares. A movement in price which would not
influence such an investor may be termed immaterial.
在判断内幕消息会否对价格造成重大影响时，须视乎该消息或资料会否
影响惯常（或相当可能会）进行该股份的交易的人决定是否买入或沽售
该股份。不会对该等投资者构成影响的价格变动可说是并不重大。
The SFC does not set boundaries or quantify criteria for significant price impact
because the same price percentage change may have different interpretations for
the shares of different Hong Kong listed companies. Therefore, the following
factors should be considered when determining whether a material effect is
likely:
香港证监会并没有就价格的重大影响定出界线或量化准则，原因是同一
个价格百分率变动对不同的香港上市公司股份而言可能有不同的解读。
因此，在厘定是否相当可能会造成重大影响时，应考虑以下因素：
(1) the anticipated magnitude of the event or set of circumstances in the
context of the totality of the company’s activity;
在该公司整体业务的背景下，该项事件或该组情况的预期重要性；
(2) the relevance of the news or information as regards the main determinants
of the price of the listed securities;
该等消息或资料与上市证券价格的主要决定因素的相关程度；
(3) the reliability of the source of the news or information;
消息或资料来源的可靠性；
(4) market variables that affect the price of listed securities in question (These
variables could include prices, returns, volatilities, liquidity, price
relationships among securities, volume, supply, demand, etc.).
影响有关上市证券价格的市场可变因素（这些可变因素可包括价格、
回报、波幅、流通量、证券之间的价格关系、数量、供应量、需求
量等）。
Common events and circumstances that Hong Kong listed companies should
consider whether disclosure obligations arise include (but are not limited to):58

in relation to the Hong Kong listed company.60
一名合理的人，如以该香港上市公司的高级人员的身分行事，会认
为该消息属关乎该香港上市公司的内幕消息。60
Hong Kong listed companies should establish effective systems and procedures
to ensure that any important news or information known to the officers can be

to determine whether disclosure is necessary.
香港上市公司应设立有效的系统及程序，以确保已为高级人员所知的任
何重要消息或资料能尽速地予以识别、评估及上报至董事会，以决定是
否有需要作出披露。
1.3.1 “As soon as reasonably practicable”

It means that Hong Kong listed companies should immediately take all
necessary steps under relevant circumstances to disclose information to the

求专业意见，以及核实有关事实。61
Hong Kong listed companies should ensure the absolute confidentiality of
relevant information before fully disclosing it to the public. If a Hong Kong
listed company considers that the required confidentiality cannot be maintained
or that the information may have been leaked, it should promptly disclose the
information to the public.62 If a Hong Kong listed company needs time to clarify
the details and impact of an event or set of circumstances before issuing a
detailed announcement to properly inform the public, the Hong Kong listed
company should consider issuing a “holding announcement”.63
香港上市公司在向公众全面披露有关消息前，应确保该消息绝对保密。
若香港上市公司认为无法保持所需的机密性，或该消息可能已外泄，便

1.4 Disclosure method
披露的方式
Inside information must be disclosed in accordance with Rule 2.07C of the
Hong Kong Listing Rules by publishing announcements on the website of the
Hong Kong Stock Exchange and the website of Hong Kong listed companies.65
Publication of announcements on the website of the Hong Kong Stock
Exchange can satisfy the requirements of Section 307C (1) of the SFO, which
requires that inside information be disclosed in a manner that enables the public
to obtain the disclosed information fairly, timely and effectively.66
内幕消息须依照香港上市规则第 2.07C 条，以在香港联交所网站和香港
上市公司网站刊发公告的方式披露。65 在香港联交所网站刊发公告能满
足《证券及期货条例》第 307C（1）条的规定，即披露内幕消息的方式
须使公众能公平、适时及有效地取得所披露的消息。66
The information contained in the announcement must be complete and accurate
in all material particulars and must not be misleading or deceptive. Even if a
Hong Kong listed company has disclosed inside information, if the disclosed
news or information is false or misleading as to a material fact, or is false or
misleading due to the omission of a material fact; and an officer of the Hong
Kong listed company knew or should have known that the disclosed news or
information falls within the above description of being false or misleading, or
was negligent as to whether the news or information falls within the above
description, then the Hong Kong listed company has failed to disclose inside
information as required.
公告所载的资料在所有要项上均须完整及准确，不得具误导性或欺骗性。
即使香港上市公司已就内幕消息进行披露，如所披露的消息或资料，在
某事关重要的事实方面属虚假或具误导性，或因遗漏某事关重要的事实
而属虚假或具误导性；及香港上市公司的一名高级人员知道或理应知道
所披露的消息或资料符合上述虚假或具误导性的说明，或在该消息或资

1. The definition and disclosure of insider trading
内幕交易的构成及披露
1.1 What constitutes an insider trading
内幕交易的构成
Rule 10b-5 of the US Securities Exchange Act prohibits illegal insider trading.
Generally speaking, Rule 10b-5 prohibits any person from buying or selling
securities based on material non-public information (“MNPI”) in violation of a
duty owed to shareholders of China-Based US-Listed Companies or where the
information has been otherwise misappropriated. Persons subject to disclosure
(or abandonment of transactions) obligations under Rule 10b-5 (“Insiders”)
include the following:
《美国证券交易法》10b-5 规则禁止非法内幕交易。总体而言，10b-5 规
则禁止任何主体违反对中概股上市公司股东的义务或不当利用
（Misappropriate）信息，基于重大非公开信息（Material Non-Public
Information，“MNPI”）买卖证券。根据 10b-5 规则需要承担披露（或
放弃交易）的义务主体(“内幕人士”）包括以下几类：
(1) Insiders of China-Based US-Listed Companies, such as directors, senior
officers and controlling shareholders, who owe fiduciary duties to the
shareholders of China-Based US-Listed Companies;
中概股上市公司内幕人士，如董事、高级管理人员以及控股股东，
该等人员对中概股上市公司股东负有尽职义务（Fiduciary Duty）；
(2) Temporary Insiders, such as lawyers, accountants, and investment bankers;
and
暂时内幕人士，如律师、会计师和投资银行；以及
(3) Outsiders who “misappropriate” confidential information for trading
purposes in breach of a duty owed to the source of the information.
出于交易之目的不当利用保密信息，并违反了其对信息来源所负义
务的外部人士。
It is important to note that even if a person does not actually conduct transactions
based on MNPI but merely passes such information to a third party (a practice
214
--- Page 223 (Text) ---
Meeting Continuing Obligations:
A Handbook for Companies Listed on Major Stock Exchanges
《履行持续义务：主要证券交易所上市公司手册》
often referred to as “tipping”), the person may still be subject to liabilities under
Rule 10b-5. Aside from the “tipper” (the person who discloses the information),
if the “tippee” (the person who receives the information and who has reason to
know that the information comes from an Insider who has breached his or her
relevant duties) conducts any transaction based on the “tipped” information, he
or she may also be subject to liabilities under Rule 10b-5. To avoid potential
liabilities under Rule 10b-5, an Insider who possesses MNPI (or a “tippee”)
must disclose that information or refrain from trading. Even if the MNPI has
been publicly released, Insiders shall allow sufficient time before buying or
selling securities after the information is announced to give the public a fair
opportunity to obtain the information.
需要注意的是，即使某主体并未实际根据重大非公开信息进行交易，而
仅是将该等信息提供给第三方（这种做法常被称为“tipping”），该主体
也可能根据 10b-5 规则承担责任。除了“tipper”（泄露信息的主体）之
外，“tippee”（接收信息的主体，且该主体有理由知道该等信息来源于
违反了相关义务的内幕人士）如果基于该等被泄露的信息进行交易，则
也可能根据 10b-5规则承担责任。为了避免违反 10b-5规则而承担相关责
任，掌握重大非公开信息的内幕人士（包括“tippee”）必须公开该等信
息，或者避免进行交易。即使重大非公开信息已公开发布，内幕人士也
应在信息公告后留出足够的时间再行买卖证券，以给予社会公众获取信
息的公平机会。
1.2 Definition of material non-public information
重大非公开信息的定义
Generally speaking, MNPI refers to information which has not yet been made
public, which, if disseminated to the public, may affect the market value or
trading price of the securities of Listed Companies, or that if disclosed may
affect the decisions of reasonable investors.
一般而言，重大非公开信息是指：若向公众传播可能会影响上市公司证
券的市场价值或交易价格、或者一经披露可能会影响合理投资者的决定
的尚未公开的信息。
1.3 Material non-public information may include:
重大非公开信息可能包括：
(1) The intention of a China-Based US-Listed Company to launch take-over
bids, auctions, public offerings, private placements, stock repurchases,
215
--- Page 224 (Text) ---

consolidations or splits;
中概股上市公司拟进行要约收购、拍卖、公开发行、私募发行、股
票回购、合并或分拆的意向；
(2) Pending covenant defaults under the credit facilities or trust indenture of
a China-Based US-Listed Company or one of its significant subsidiaries;
中概股上市公司或其重要子公司的贷款协议或信托契约下可能发生
的违约；
(3) Pending resignation or dismissal of one or more senior officers of a China-
Based US-Listed Company or its significant subsidiaries;
中概股上市公司或其重要子公司的一名或多名高级管理人员即将辞
职或被解雇；
(4) Potential acquisitions or sales of significant assets or businesses;
对于重大资产或重大业务的潜在收购或出售；
(5) The intention of another US listed company to initiate a take-over bid or
propose a merger with a China-Based US-Listed Company;
另一美国上市公司有意发起针对中概股上市公司的要约收购或合并；
(6) Pending material legal or regulatory proceedings or settlements;
未决的重大法律或监管程序或和解；
(7) Potential rating changes; or
可能的评级变更；或者
(8) Pending earnings disclosures that are inconsistent with expectations.
与预期不一致的待定收益的披露。
1.4 Insider trading safe harbor (Rule 10b5-1)
内幕交易安全港（10b5-1规则）
Rule 10b5-1 is a rule formulated by the SEC in accordance with Rule 10b-5 of
the US Securities Exchange Act, which took effect in October 2000. It is
purported to address insider trading issues that may be involved when traders
use or hold MNPI. Rule 10b5-1 allows Insiders to plan in advance the share
price, timing and other matters of selling and buying stocks through a prepared
trading plan (“10b5-1 Plan”) as long as they are not aware of MNPI. Insiders
must conduct transactions strictly in accordance with the 10b5-1 Plan to prove
216
--- Page 225 (Text) ---
Meeting Continuing Obligations:
A Handbook for Companies Listed on Major Stock Exchanges
《履行持续义务：主要证券交易所上市公司手册》
that they do not use inside information in their transactions. If faced with insider
trading charges, traders can use the 10b5-1 Plan to affirmatively defend
themselves. To use Rule 10b5-1 for an affirmative defense (“Affirmative
Defense”), the following conditions must be met:
10b5-1规则是 SEC 根据《美国证券交易法》10b-5 规则制定、于 2000 年
10 月生效的一项规则，旨在解决交易方使用或持有重大非公开信息时可
能涉及的内幕交易问题。10b5-1 规则允许内幕人士在不知晓重大非公开
信息的前提下，通过预先制定好的交易计划（“10b5-1 计划”）对其出售
和购买股票的价格、时间等事项做出提前规划，且严格按照 10b5-1 计划
进行交易，以证明他们没有在交易中使用重大非公开信息。若面临内幕
交易指控，交易方可以据此进行积极性抗辩。适用 10b5-1 规则进行积极
性抗辩（Affirmative Defense，“积极性抗辩”）需满足以下条件：
(1) The 10b5-1 Plan is entered into in good faith and not as part of a plan or
scheme to evade the prohibitions related to Rule 10b-5;
10b5-1 计划是出于善意制定的，设立该计划的目的不是为了规避
10b-5规则相关禁令；
(2) The 10b5-1 Plan is entered into when the traders are not aware of any
MNPI about the issuer and its securities;
10b5-1 计划是在交易方不知晓发行人及其证券任何重大非公开信息
的情况下设立的；
(3) The 10b5-1 Plan specifies in writing the price, amount and date of the
transaction, or the formula, algorithm, or computer program for
determining such price, amount, and date;
10b5-1 计划需书面确定交易的价格、数量、时间，或确定该等价格、
数量、时间的公式、算法或计算机程序；
(4) After the implementation of the 10b5-1 Plan, traders do not exercise any
subsequent influence on the trading method, time, etc., and the relevant
parties executing such trades (broker-dealers) also are not aware of any
MNPI; and
10b5-1 计划实施后，交易方未对交易方式、时间等施加任何后续影
响，且执行交易的相关方（经济交易商）同样不知晓任何重大非公
开信息；以及
(5) Securities trading activities are conducted in accordance with the 10b5-1
217

Meeting Continuing Obligations:

Plan.
证券的交易活动按照 10b5-1计划进行。
It is noteworthy that the 10b5-1 Plan is particularly applicable to those who hold
MNPI, and provides major shareholders, directors, senior officers, related
parties and other Insiders (including the issuer itself) of China-Based US-Listed
Companies with the flexibility to trade in the stocks of China-Based US-Listed
Companies at sensitive timing (e.g., during sensitive period of insider
information).
可见，10b5‐1 计划特别适用于持有重大非公开信息的人士，为中概股上
市公司的大股东、董事、高级管理人员、关联方及其他内幕人士（包括
发行人本身）提供了在敏感时点（如内幕信息敏感期）交易中概股上市
公司股票的灵活性。
The SEC amended Rule 10b5-1 on December 14, 2022, and such amendment
took effect on February 27, 2023. The amended Rule 10b5-1 imposes higher
requirements for Insiders of China-Based US-Listed Companies to trade stocks
through the 10b5-1 Plan and use Affirmative Defense. The main changes
include:
SEC于当地时间 2022年12月 14日对10b5-1规则进行了修改，该等修改
已于 2023 年 2 月 27 日生效。修改后的 10b5-1 规则对中概股上市公司内
幕人士通过 10b5-1 计划交易股票并进行积极性抗辩提出了更高的要求，
修改的主要内容包括：
(1) a new cooling-off period requirement, that is, after the adoption or
modification of the 10b5-1 Plan, the transaction plan shall not be executed

any event, this required cooling-off period shall not exceed a maximum
of 120 days after the adoption or modification of the 10b5-1 Plan). Except
for the issuer, its directors and its senior officers, the cooling-off period
for other Insiders is 30 days;
新增冷静期要求，即制订或修改10b5-1计划后，需要经过一定的冷
静期才能实施该交易计划。对董事和高级管理人员而言，冷静期以
下述二者后发生的时间为准：（1）10b5-1计划通过或修改后的90天；

aware of any MNPI about the issuer and its securities; and
要求董事和高级管理人员在10b5-1计划中声明：（1）10b5-1计划是
出于善意制定的，设立该计划的目的不是为了规避 10b-5 规则的相
关禁令；（2）其不知晓发行人及其证券的任何重大非公开信息；以

的信息：
(1) it consists of readily observable matter;
它由容易观察到的物质组成；

to, bring it to the attention of persons who commonly invest; and

(a) information referred to in paragraph (1);
上述第（1）项提及的资料；
(b) information made known as referred to in paragraph (2)(a).
上述第（2）（a）项提及的信息。
A “person who commonly invests” is a person who commonly invests in
securities, securities-based derivatives contracts or CIS units where the price or
value may be affected by the information. The determination of the types of
investors who are common investors is very much product-specific. For
example, generally speaking, investors include retail investors, accredited
investors, expert investors and institutional investors. However, when referring
to securities-based derivatives contracts, retail investors are not common
investors.75
“普通投资者”是指通常投资于价格或价值可能受该信息影响的证券、
证券衍生品合约或 CIS 单位的人。普通投资者很大程度上取决于具体产
品。例如，一般来说，投资者包括散户投资者、合格投资者、专业投资
者以及机构投资者。然而，在提及证券衍生品合约时，散户并不属于普
通投资者 75。
The purpose of the provisions of paragraph (2)(a) above is to ensure that
materially price sensitive information is disseminated through channels which
would, or would be likely to, reach all common investors of the relevant
financial product. Therefore, whether these common investors have the same
ability to process the information is not concerned.76
上述第（2）（a）项规定的目的是确保重大价格敏感信息的传播渠道能够
接触到或很可能接触到所有通常投资于相关金融产品的人，使他们能够
平等地获取信息。因此，这些“普通投资者”处理信息的能力是否相同
并不在该条考虑范围内 76。
1.1.3 Information that a reasonable person would expect to have a material impact
合理的人预期将会产生重大影响的信息
Under Article 216 of the Singapore Securities and Futures Act, a reasonable

listed company are required to comply with the Model Code and any breach of
these standards will be regarded as a breach of the Hong Kong Listing Rules.

注册股份有限公司发行人则包括监事）于买卖其所属香港上市公司的证
券时，用以衡量其本身操守的所需标准。香港上市公司亦可自行采纳一
套比《标准守则》所订标准更高的守则。所有香港上市公司董事（及监

A “relevant employee” includes any employee or such a director or employee
of a subsidiary or holding company who, by virtue of his position or

有关雇员买卖香港上市公司证券事宜设定书面指引，指引内容应该不比
《标准守则》宽松。“有关雇员”包括任何因其职务或雇员关系而可能
会管有关于香港上市公司或其证券的内幕消息的雇员，或附属公司或控
股公司的此等董事或雇员 99。
A director of a Hong Kong listed company shall endeavor to ensure that any
employee of his company, or any director or employee of a subsidiary, does not
take advantage of any inside information relating to the securities of any Hong

Hong Kong’s regime in relation to disclosure of interests, which is set out in
Part XV of the SFO, requires substantial shareholders, directors and chief
executives of a Hong Kong listed company to disclose interests in the

issued the “Outline of Part XV of the Securities and Futures Ordinance (Cap.
571) - Disclosure of Interests” (the “SFC Disclosure of Interests Outline”) to
provide guidance on the circumstances under which notifications are required
to be filed under the regime in relation to disclosure of interests.
香港权益披露制度载于《证券及期货条例》第 XV 部，要求香港上市公
司的大股东、董事及最高行政人员披露在该公司股份的权益和淡仓和债

3.1.5 Options
期权
When a Hong Kong listed company allots shares or issues an instrument and
agrees to allot shares or grant options over its own unissued shares in accordance
with the relevant instrument, it does not have any long or short position in its
own shares. The company is simply issuing or agreeing to issue the shares in
question and therefore no disclosure is required. If the Hong Kong listed
company does not have a short position, the controller of the Hong Kong listed
company would not be regarded as having a short position and would not be
required to disclose it.
当香港上市公司配发股份或发行文书，并同意根据有关文书配发股份或
就其本身的未发行股份授予期权时，该公司并没有就其本身的股份持有
任何好仓或淡仓。该公司纯粹只是发行或同意发行有关股份，因此无需
披露。假如该香港上市公司没有淡仓，则该香港上市公司的控制人不会
被视为持有淡仓，亦无需披露。
3.1.6 Reporting on the changes in the nature of interests
权益性质改变具报
Any change in the nature of a notifiable interest must be disclosed.118 Such a
change occurs in a wide range of circumstances, including when the nature of a
person’s ownership of shares changes, when there is a change in any of a
person’s legal or equitable interests, and when a person exercises rights under
equity derivatives in respect of which he owns the shares, or when the rights
under those instruments are exercised against him.
需具报的权益性质的任何改变均须披露 118。出现这种改变的情况很广泛，
包括当某人对股份的所有权的性质改变、当某人在法律上或衡平法上的
任何权益有所改变，及当某人行使以他拥有的股份为相关股份的股本衍
生工具下的权利时，或在该等工具下的权利针对他而行使时的改变。
Common scenarios where a change in notifiable interest is required include:
需要具报权益改变的常见情况包括：
(1) the exercise of rights in options and other derivatives (whether exercised
by or against a person);

(1) if at the time the purchaser takes delivery of the voting shares, the person
has previously disclosed an equitable interest arising from the contractual
purchase of the shares;

relevant shares in issue.
该项改变是因在任何股本衍生工具下的权利的行使条款改变所致，
而该项条款改变，则是由于相关股份发行数目有所改变而引致的。
3.1.7 Composition of interests in shares – purchase and sale of shares
股份权益构成 —— 购买及出售股份
A purchaser of shares acquires an interest in the shares when he enters into a
purchase contract and is therefore required to make a notification within three
business days of the contract being entered into. A separate notification is not
required when the purchaser takes delivery of the shares.
股份买方在订立购买合约时取得股份中的权益，因此其需要在合约签订
后三个营业日内作出具报。当买方提取股份时，无需另行具报。
Generally, a seller of shares ceases to have an interest in the shares only when
the seller actually transfers the shares to the purchaser, and is therefore required
to notify the cessation of his interest within three business days of the settlement
date (i.e. the date of the actual transfer). If the contract for the sale of shares
provides for settlement within four days after the Hong Kong Stock Exchange
opens for business, the seller is not required to notify on entering into the
contract.120
一般情况下，只有当股份卖方实际将股份转让给买方时，该股份卖方才
不再拥有权益，因此卖方须在结算日（即实际转让日期）后三个营业日
内具报其权益的终止。如果股份出售合约规定在香港联交所营业后的四
日内完成结算，卖方无需就订立合约作出具报 120。
If in fact the seller ceases to be interested on the date of the sale contract (e.g.
due to the operation of a clearing system), a notification should be made within
three business days after the signing of the sale contract.
如果事实上卖方在出售合约签订之日不再拥有权益（如由于清算系统的
运作），应在出售合约签订后三个营业日内作出具报。
If the contract of sale specifies that settlement is to take place five or more
trading days after the Hong Kong Stock Exchange opens for business following
120 Section 5 of Securities and Futures (Disclosure of Interests—Exclusions) Regulation (Cap. 571AG).
120 《证券及期货（披露权益——除外情况）规例》（第571AG章）第5条。

the signing of the contract, two notifications are required: (1) a notification of
change of interest within three business days after the signing of the contract
and (2) a notification of cessation of interest within three business days after the
delivery of the shares.
如出售合约指明在合约签订后，在香港联交所营业后的五个交易日或以
上完成结算，需要发出两份具报：分别是：（1）权益性质改变的具报须
在合约签订后三个营业日内发出及（2）不再拥有权益的具报须在交付股
份后的三个营业日内发出。
3.1.8 Deemed interests
认定权益
In calculating the number of shares owned by a person, the interests and
derivative interests of the following other persons in the shares of a Hong Kong
listed company shall be added:
在计算某人拥有的股份数目时，须加上以下其他人士在香港上市公司股
份中的权益及衍生权益：
(1) Family members and controlled corporations
家属及受控公司
(2) Limited liability partnerships
有限责任合伙企业
(3) Trusts
信托
(4) Discretionary trusts “founders”
酌情信托“成立人”
(5) All other persons with whom that person has agreed to act in concert to
acquire an interest in the shares of the listed corporation
与该某人约定采取一致行动以取得上市法团的股份的权益的所有其
他人士
3.1.9 Disclosure duties resulting from share repurchases and placing
因股票回购和配售而产生的披露责任
Disclosure obligations may also arise from the actions of others. For example,
a disclosure obligation may arise if a Hong Kong listed company repurchases
266
--- Page 275 (Text) ---
Meeting Continuing Obligations:
A Handbook for Companies Listed on Major Stock Exchanges
《履行持续义务：主要证券交易所上市公司手册》
shares, resulting in a reduction in the number of shares in issue, which
subsequently results in an increase in the percentage level of the remaining
shareholders’ interests.
披露责任也可能因其他人的行动而产生。例如，如果香港上市公司购回
股份，引致已发行股份的数目下降，继而导致其余股东权益的百分比水
平增加，便可能产生披露责任。
Conversely, if a Hong Kong listed company issues additional shares following
a placing, such as new shares to a substantial shareholder in lieu of the shares it
has placed with a third party, and the interests of the other shareholders are
diluted as a result, the reduction in the percentage level of their interests should
be disclosed.
相反，如香港上市公司于配售后增发，如向大股东发行新股，以取代其
向第三人所配售的股份，其他股东权益因而被摊薄，则其权益百分比水
平的减少应予以披露。
In both cases, the three-business day disclosure period is calculated only from
the date on which the relevant person becomes aware of the facts giving rise to
the change in his interest (i.e. the date on which he becomes aware of the
reduction/increase in the number of shares in issue).
上述两种情况中，三个营业日的披露期限仅从相关人士察觉导致其权益
改变的事实之日起计算（即他知道已发行股份数目减少/增加的日期）。
3.1.10 Cease to have an interest
不再拥有权益
A person is deemed to have ceased to be interested in shares if:
如有以下情况，任何人即视为已不再拥有股份权益：
(1) under a contract of sale, he delivers an interest in shares to another person
or delivers such shares at the direction of another person, to satisfy his
obligations under a call option or to exercise his rights under a put option;
根据出售合约，他将股份权益交付另一人或依照另一人的指示将该
等股份交付，以履行其在看涨期权下的责任或行使其在看跌期权下
的权利；
(2) his right to subscribe for or require delivery of such shares is time-barred
or he has transferred that right to another person;
267
--- Page 276 (Text) ---
Meeting Continuing Obligations:

《履行持续义务：主要证券交易所上市公司手册》
他认购或要求交付该股份的权利已失时效或他将该权利转让予另一
人；
(3) his liability to take delivery of the shares is time-barred or he has
transferred that liability to another person;
他须提取该股份的责任已失时效或他将该责任转让予另一人；
(4) he receives a payment from another person or is able to avoid or minimize
a loss thereby on the transfer or settlement of any cash-settled equity
derivative.
他在转让或结算任何现金结算股本衍生工具时，向另一人收取一笔
款项或得以藉此避免或减少损失。
3.1.11 Exemptions

There are various exemptions and some entitlements that need not be regarded.
They are detailed and hence only the major ones are briefly summarized below.

3.2 Directors and Chief Executives
董事及最高行政人员
3.2.1 Discloseable interests
须予披露的权益
Directors and chief executives of Hong Kong listed companies (hereinafter
referred to as “Directors”) are subject to more disclosure requirements than
substantial shareholders, and are required to disclose any interest (not limited to
voting shares) in shares or debentures of a Hong Kong listed company and any
associated corporations. The disclosure is required regardless of the size of the
interest owned.
香港上市公司董事及最高行政人员（以下简称为“董事”）的披露要求
要多于大股东，须披露任何拥有香港上市公司及任何相联法团的股份或
债权证权益（不只限于有投票权股份）。无论拥有的权益大小，皆须披露。
3.2.2 Definition of an associated corporation
相联法团定义
An associated corporation means a holding company and subsidiaries of a Hong
Kong listed company, a subsidiary of a holding company of a Hong Kong listed
269
--- Page 278 (Text) ---
Meeting Continuing Obligations:
A Handbook for Companies Listed on Major Stock Exchanges
《履行持续义务：主要证券交易所上市公司手册》
company and any company in which a Hong Kong listed company owns more
than 20% of the issued shares of that class.
相联法团指香港上市公司的控权公司及附属公司、香港上市公司控权公
司的附属公司以及任何公司，其中香港上市公司拥有该类别已发行股份
20%以上的权益。
3.2.3 Examples of associated corporations
相联法团范例
In the above structure, each of A to F are associated corporations of the Hong
Kong listed company. Only G and H do not qualify as an associated corporation
(provided that each is not in fact controlled by the Hong Kong listed company).
270
--- Page 279 (Text) ---
Meeting Continuing Obligations:
A Handbook for Companies Listed on Major Stock Exchanges
《履行持续义务：主要证券交易所上市公司手册》
在以上的架构中，A 至 F 每个都是该香港上市公司的相联法团。只有 G
及 H 不符合资格成为相联法团（前提是它们实际上并没有受到该香港上
市公司所控制）。
A Hong Kong listed company holds an interest of one-third or more of the voting
rights in a corporation C and is therefore deemed to be interested in any shares
that corporation C holds in corporation F.121 As a result, the Hong Kong listed
company is deemed to be interested in 21% of the shares of corporation F, which
meets the definition of an “associated corporation”.
香港上市公司持有 C 法团三分之一或以上的投票权的权益，故此香港上
市公司被视为对 C 法团所持有的 F 法团的任何股份拥有权益 121。因此，
香港上市公司被视为持有F法团21%的权益，而F法团符合“相联法团”
的定义。
The Hong Kong listed company holds a direct interest of 21% in corporation D
which is therefore an “associated corporation”, but the Hong Kong listed
company does not hold more than 20% interest in corporation G to meet the
definition of “associated corporation” (as its interest is calculated as 21% x 51%
= 10.71%). Corporation B is a subsidiary of the holding company of the Hong
Kong listed company and therefore meets the definition of “associated
corporation”, but Corporation H is not a subsidiary of the holding company of
the Hong Kong listed company and does not meet the definition of “associated
corporation”.
香港上市公司持有 D法团 21%的直接权益，故此 D法团为“相联法团”，
但香港上市公司并无持有 G 法团 20%以上的权益以符合“相联法团”的
定义（因其权益的计算方法为：21%x51%=10.71%）。B 法团为香港上市
公司的控股公司的附属公司，故此符合“相联法团”的定义，但 H 法团
并非香港上市公司的控股公司的附属公司，不符合“相联法团”的定义。
3.2.4 Relevant events to be disclosed
须披露的有关事件
Directors are required to disclose any of the following “relevant events”122:
香港上市公司的董事须披露下列任何“有关事件”122：
121 Section 344(3) of SFO.

他将香港上市公司授予他的认购该公司的股份或债权证的权利转让；
(5) an associated corporation grants him the right to subscribe for shares in or
debentures of the associated corporation and he exercises or assigns that
right;
相联法团授予他认购该相联法团的股份或债权证的权利，而他行使
该项权利或将该项权利转让；

(7) when he has or ceases to have a short position in shares of that Hong Kong
listed company or any of its associated corporations.

仓。

him as part of a rights issue and upon delivery of the shares to him on completion
of the rights issue.
期权及其它工具下的权利行使及把股份作为抵押（合资格借出人除外）

3.2.8 Deemed interests
认定权益
Interests and derivative interests of the Director’s spouse and minor children
(who are not Directors themselves), controlled corporations (i.e. where he
controls the exercise of not less than one-third of the voting power at general
meetings of the company or where its directors are accustomed to, or under a
duty to, act in accordance with his directions or instructions) and trusts are
deemed to be interests of a Director. A Director is also required to disclose
interests under discretionary trusts.
董事的配偶及未成年子女（本身并非该香港上市公司的董事）、其控制的
公司（即其在公司股东大会上控制不少于三分之一的投票权的行使或该
公司董事惯于或有责任按照其指令或指示行事）及信托中的权益及衍生
权益视为董事的权益。董事亦须披露酌情信托下的权益。
Although a Director is not required to take into account the interests of his

美国上市公司股票实益所有权及其变动的披露要求
The disclosure requirements for beneficial ownership and changes in beneficial
ownership of shares of US listed companies are primarily set out in Section 13
(“Section 13”) and Section 16 (“Section 16”) of the US Securities Exchange
Act of 1934. Section 16 requires officers and directors of a US listed company,
as well as individuals and entities that directly or indirectly hold beneficial
ownership of more than 10% of the US listed company’s shares (“Section 16
Reporting Persons”), to make public filings; Section 13 requires individuals
and entities that directly or indirectly hold more than 5% beneficial ownership
of a US listed company to make public filings with the SEC when they acquire
such beneficial ownership and when there is a change in the amount of such
beneficial ownership. Insiders of foreign private issuers are currently exempt
from Section 16 reporting requirement.

1.2 Disclosure requirements under Section 13
第 13条的披露要求
Shareholders who directly or indirectly hold beneficial ownership of more than
5% of the shares of a US listed company are required to report to the SEC
through Form 13D or Form 13G (simplified form applicable under certain
circumstances) at the time of the acquisition of such beneficial ownership, and
at the time of any change in such beneficial ownership. On October 10, 2023,
the SEC amended the disclosure requirements of beneficial ownership under
Section 13. The main revision of this amendment includes adjustments to the
deadlines for reporting obligations under different circumstances. Apart from
adjustments regarding shortening the filing deadlines for Form 13G, which will
be effective from September 30, 2024, the other adjustments have come into
effect since February 5, 2024.

为前述变化发生的 2个工作日之内）。
1.3 Criteria for defining the threshold of beneficial ownership in Section 16 vs.
Section 13
第 16条与第 13条界定实益所有权数额的标准
Both Section 16 (including relevant rules (e.g. Rule 16a)) and Section 13
(including relevant rules) impose reporting requirements on shareholders who
hold more than a certain amount of beneficial ownership in a US listed company,
but the threshold for defining such beneficial ownership are different: under
Section 16, the beneficial ownership focuses more on the holding of economic
interests, that is, whether the relevant entity directly or indirectly enjoys
(including jointly enjoys) the pecuniary interest in the relevant shares. For
example, a person having an indirect pecuniary interest in shares through a trust
or estate arrangement will be treated as a beneficial owner under Section 16. By
contrast, the beneficial ownership under Section 13 places more emphasis on
the voting and investment disposition power over the shares. If several
shareholders agree to act in concert with respect to their shares, each shareholder
may be deemed to have beneficial ownership of the aggregate amount of all of
the concerted shares under the standard of Section 13 because each concerted
shareholder has voting and investment disposition power with respect to all of
the concerted shares collectively.
第 16条及相关规则（如 16a规则）与第 13条及相关规则均对持有美国上
市公司一定数额以上实益所有权的股东提出了申报要求，但两者对于界
定实益所有权数额的标准有所不同：第 16 条项下的实益所有权更侧重经
济利益的持有，即相关主体是否直接或者间接享有（包括共同享有）对
282
--- Page 291 (Text) ---
Meeting Continuing Obligations:
A Handbook for Companies Listed on Major Stock Exchanges
《履行持续义务：主要证券交易所上市公司手册》
相关股票的金钱利益（pecuniary interest）。例如，相关主体通过信托或遗
产安排间接享有股票的金钱利益，该等主体将因此而被视为第 16 条项下
的实益所有权人。而第 13 条规定的实益所有权则更关注股票的投票权和
投资决策权，如果某几个股东同意对其所持股票采取一致行动，因为每
个一致行动的股东都对所有采取一致行动的股票（共同）享有投票决定
权和投资处置权，根据第 13 条的界定标准，每一个股东可能都被视为对
于所有采取一致行动的股票的总额拥有实益所有权。
1.4 Exemptions from restrictions on trading in the shares of US listed
companies - Rule 144 and Rule 10b5-1 trading plans
美国上市公司股票交易限制之豁免——144规则及 10b5-1交易计划
1.4.1 Rule 144
144规则
Pursuant to SEC Rule 144 (“Rule 144”), persons or entities that acquire
securities of a US listed company through a placement other than a public
offering, as well as persons and entities deemed to be “affiliates” of a US listed
company, may sell their shares to the public through Rule 144. Rule 144
provides different exemptions depending on whether the seller is an “affiliate”
of a US listed company.
根据 SEC的 144规则（“144 规则”），通过公开发行之外的配售途径获
得美国上市公司证券的个人或实体以及被视为美国上市公司“关联方”
的个人和实体可以通过 144 规则向公众出售股份。根据转让方是否是美
国上市公司的“关联方”，144规则提出了不同的豁免规则。
(1) Affiliates
关联方
An “affiliate” is a person or entity that, directly or indirectly through one
or more intermediaries, controls or is controlled by, or is under common
control with, a listed company, where “control” means the possession of
the power, directly or indirectly, to direct or direct through others, the
management and policies of the company through holding voting
securities, by contract or other means. The SEC determines “affiliates” on
a case-by-case basis, but generally speaking, shareholders who hold more
than 10% of the beneficial ownership of a listed company, officers and
members of the board of directors of a listed company are considered
“affiliates” of a US listed company. In view of the risk of “affiliates”
283
--- Page 292 (Text) ---
Meeting Continuing Obligations:
A Handbook for Companies Listed on Major Stock Exchanges
《履行持续义务：主要证券交易所上市公司手册》
utilizing insider trading information and unfair trading advantages to
commit securities fraud, in order to enhance the fairness of market
transactions, the US Securities Act requires that “affiliates” of a US listed
company selling their beneficial ownership of a listed company acquired
at any point in time before, after, or in the course of the company’s public
offering to comply with the restrictions in Rule 144 as follows:
“关联方”是指直接或通过一个或多个中间方间接控制上市公司，
或受上市公司控制，或与上市公司处于共同控制之下的个人或实体，
其中“控制”是指通过持有具有表决权的证券、合同或其他方式，
直接或间接地拥有指导或通过他人指导公司管理和政策的权力。
SEC 对于“关联方”的认定将依据个案的具体情况进行判断，但一
般而言持有上市公司 10%以上实益所有权的股东、公司高级管理人
员及董事成员均属于美国上市公司“关联方”。鉴于“关联方”存
在利用内幕交易信息和不公平交易优势进行证券欺诈的风险，为增
强市场交易的公平性，《美国证券法》规定美国上市公司“关联方”
出售其在公司公开发行前、公开发行后和公开发行过程中任何时点
取得的上市公司实益所有权均须遵守 144规则的限制，具体如下：
(a) Holding period. An “affiliate” must hold the shares for a certain
period of time before selling them on the open market. If the issuer
itself is a reporting company126, the “affiliate” must hold the shares
for at least 6 months before selling. If the issuer is a non-reporting
company, the “affiliate” must hold the shares for at least one year
prior to sale to the public. The holding period begins when the
shares were bought and fully paid for. It should be noted that the
holding period requirement applies only to restricted securities;
securities acquired on the open market are not subject to the holding
period restriction.
持有期限。“关联方”在公开市场售股之前，必须对股票持
有一定期限。如果发行人本身是报告公司（Reporting
Company）126，则“关联方”在出售之前需持有股票至少 6个
月。如果发行人本身是非报告公司，则“关联方”在出售之
前需持有股票至少1年。持有期限自买入且付款之日起算。需
126 That is, a company that has been subject to the reporting requirements of Section 13 or Section 15(d)
of the US Securities Exchange Act for at least 90 days prior to the sale of shares.
126 即在售股前至少90日受限于《美国证券交易法》第13条或第15（d）条报告要求的公司。
284

《履行持续义务：主要证券交易所上市公司手册》
要注意的是，持有期限要求仅适用于限制性证券，公开市场
上获得的证券不受持有期的约束。
(b) Current public information. An “affiliate” must provide adequate
and current information about the issuer prior to the sale of shares,
i.e., the issuer must meet the quarterly and annual reporting
requirements of the US Securities Exchange Act. If the issuer itself
is a non-reporting company, information about the issuer, including
the nature of its business, its directors and officers, and its financial
statements must be publicly available.
发行人当前信息。“关联方”在出售股票前必须充分提供发
行人的最新信息，即发行人必须满足《美国证券交易法》中
有关季度和年度报告的要求。如果发行人本身是非报告公司，
则要求提供该发行人的相关信息，包括其业务性质、董事及
高级管理人员，以及财务报表等须为公众所知。
(c) Volume limitations. The number of shares sold by an “affiliate”
during any 3-month period may not exceed 1% of the total number
of the outstanding shares or be more than 1% of the average daily
trading volume (“ADTV”) of that class of securities for the previous
4 weeks (whichever is higher). If an “affiliate” co-sells shares with
others during the 3-month period, the number of shares co-sold will
be aggregated to determine the number of shares that can be co-sold
as a whole. Shares sold through an effective registration statement
and shares sold pursuant to an exemption from the rules of Section
4 of the US Securities Act that do not constitute a public offering
shall not be counted toward the foregoing volume limitations.
交易量限制。“关联方”在任意三个月期间出售的股票数量
不得超过该类证券发行总量的 1%，或者不能超过该类证券前
四周平均交易量（Average Daily Trading Volume，“ADTV”）
的1%（二者孰高）。如果“关联方”在3个月期限内与其他人
员共同销售股票，则其共同销售的数量将被合并计算，作为
一个整体确定可共同销售的股票数量。通过生效的注册声明
出售的股份以及根据《美国证券法》第 4条（Section 4）的豁
免规则且不构成公开发行的方式出售的股份无需计入前述交
易量限制。
(d) Manner of sale. The sale can only be made through a broker and in
285
--- Page 294 (Text) ---
Meeting Continuing Obligations:
A Handbook for Companies Listed on Major Stock Exchanges
《履行持续义务：主要证券交易所上市公司手册》
accordance with routine shares transactions, and the broker cannot
charge a higher-than-normal commission. In addition, neither the
“affiliate” nor the broker may actively solicit buyers to purchase
such shares.
出售方式。出售只能通过股票经纪人并按照常规股票交易进
行，且股票经纪人不能收取高于正常水平的佣金。另外，
“关联方”和经纪人均不得主动招揽买方购买该等股票。
(e) Filing of notice of proposed share sales with the SEC. An “affiliate”
is required to file a Form 144 with the SEC if the sale exceeds 5,000
shares or the amount of the sale exceeds US$50,000 in any 3-month
period.
向 SEC 提交售股报告。如果在 3 个月内出售的股票数量超过
5,000 股或者涉及的出售金额超过 50,000 美元，则“关联方”
需要向SEC提交144表格。
(2) Non-affiliates
非关联方
Shares acquired by non-affiliates in the public offering and in the public
market after the public offering may be sold freely, subject to applicable
lock-up agreements.
在遵守适用的禁售协议（Lock-up Agreements）的前提下，非关联
方在公开发行时以及在公开发行后通过公开市场上获得的股份可以
自由出售。
Shares acquired by non-affiliates prior to a company’s public offering are
generally not subject to the volume and manner of sale restrictions
described above, but are subject to the relevant restrictions on holding
period. If the issuer is a Reporting Company, non-affiliates may not sell
such shares in the public market for 6 months from the date of acquisition.
If the issuer is a non-reporting company, non-affiliates are prohibited from
selling in the open market for 1 year from the date of acquisition of such
shares.
非关联方在公司公开发行前获得的股份一般无需受到上述交易量和
出售方式限制，但需遵守持有时间的相关限制。若发行人为报告公
司，非关联方自获得该等股票之日起 6 个月内不得在公开市场上出
286

售。若发行人为非报告公司，非关联方自获得该等股票之日起 1 年
内不得在公开市场上出售。
1.4.2 Rule 10b5-1
10b5-1规则
The Rule 10b5-1 provides flexibility for substantial shareholders, directors,
executive officers, affiliates and other insiders (including the issuer itself) of a
US listed company to trade in the company’s shares at sensitive times (e.g.,
during sensitive period of insider information), as described in the section above
(paragraph 1.4 Insider trading safe harbor (Rule 10b5-1) of Part I: Composition
and Disclosure of Inside Information – United States).
10b5‐1 规则为美国上市公司的大股东、董事、高级管理人员、关联方及
其他内幕人士（包括发行人本身）提供了在敏感时点（如内幕信息敏感
期）交易公司股票的灵活性，具体请见上文（第一部分内幕消息的构成

1. Restrictions on trading in shares
股份买卖的限制
1.1 Summary
概述
Chapter 11 of the SGX Listing Rules governs the acquisition of shares in listed
companies. In addition, Rule 1101 provides that other takeover-related
requirements can be found in the Singapore Code on Take-overs and Mergers
(the “Singapore Takeovers Code”) issued by MAS, which is specifically
administered and enforced by the Securities Industry Council of Singapore (the
“SIC”). Although the Singapore Takeovers Code is not law, it is generally
upheld by the SIC and a failure to comply would lead to private and/or public
censure by the SIC and may also result in restrictions from trading on the
Exchange. The SIC will also refer criminal offenses involving breaches of the
Singapore Companies Act, the Singapore Securities and Futures Act or any
other provisions of law to the relevant authorities.
上市规则第 11 章规定了上市公司股份收购事宜。此外，第 1101 条还规
定，其他收购相关要求可以在 MAS 发布的《新加坡收购及并购守则》
（以下称“《收购守则》”）中找到，该守则由新加坡证券业委员会
（the Securities Industry Council，以下称“委员会”）具体管理与执行。
虽然《收购守则》并非法律，担其通常被委员会主张和维护，但违反该
守则将受到委员会的私下谴责、公开批评等处罚，在新交所的交易也可
能会受到限制。委员会还会将涉及违反《公司法》、《证券及期货法》或
任何其他法律规定的刑事犯罪行为转呈给有关当局。
1.2 Mandatory offers
强制要约
Rule 14.1 of the Singapore Takeovers Code requires an offer to be made
immediately by an acquirer (and his concert parties, if any) to all classes of
shareholders of an issuer, unless the consent of the SIC has been obtained, in
the following circumstances:
288
--- Page 297 (Text) ---
Meeting Continuing Obligations:
A Handbook for Companies Listed on Major Stock Exchanges
《履行持续义务：主要证券交易所上市公司手册》
《收购守则》第 14.1 条规定，在以下情况下，除非已获得新加坡证券业
协会（SIC）的同意，否则收购方（及其，如有的话，一切关联方）必须
立即向发行人所有股东提出要约：
(1) any person who, whether or not through a series of transactions over a
period of time, acquires shares which, when combined with the shares
held or acquired by persons acting in concert with him, amount to 30% or
more of the voting shares of the company; or
任何人，无论是否在一段时间内通过一系列交易，获得股份，这些
股份与其一致行动人所持有或获得的股份合并在一起，达到公司有
表决权股份 30%或以上的；或
(2) any person who, together with persons acting in concert with him, holds
not less than 30% but not more than 50% of the voting rights, and such
person, or any person acting in concert with him, acquires an additional
1% of the voting shares in any six-month period.
任何人与其一致行动人一起，持有不少于 30%但不超过 50%的表决
权，并且该人或任何与其一致行动的人，在任意 6 个月内额外获得
1%的有表决权股份。
“Concert parties” are parties that cooperate by entering into a formal or informal
agreement or memorandum of understanding to acquire or effectively
consolidate control of another company through the acquisition of shares in that
company by either party. The Singapore Takeovers Code provides that related
parties in a particular relationship (e.g. between close relatives) will be
presumed to be acting in concert.
“一致行动人”是指各方达成正式或非正式协议或谅解备忘录进行合作，
并通过任意一方收购其他公司的股份，以获得或有效巩固对该公司的控
制。《收购守则》规定了特定关系中的相关方（例如近亲之间）将被推定
为一致行动人。
1.3 Offer price
要约价格
Rule 14.3 of the Singapore Takeover Code provides that the takeover price
should not be less than the highest price paid by the offeror or any concert party
for any voting shares during the offer period and the six months prior to the date
of the announcement of the offer. The specific minimum price determination is
set out in Rule 14.3.
289

Meeting Continuing Obligations:
A Handbook for Companies Listed on Major Stock Exchanges
《履行持续义务：主要证券交易所上市公司手册》
《收购守则》第 14.3 条规定，收购价格不低于要约人或任何一致行动人
在要约期间和要约公告日之前的 6 个月内就任何有表决权的股份支付的
最高价格。具体最低价格确定方式见第 14.3条。
1.4 Voluntary offers
自愿要约
A shareholder may make a voluntary offer under Rule 15 of the Singapore
Takeovers Code even if the threshold for a mandatory offer under Rule 14 of
the Singapore Takeovers Code has not been met. A voluntary offer is conditional
conditional upon the offeror receiving acceptances in respect of voting rights
which, together with voting rights acquired or agreed to be acquired before or
during the offer, will result in the offeror and person acting in concert with it
holding more than 50% of the voting rights (or any other higher threshold
required by the buyer) before or during the offer period.
即使未达到《收购守则》第 14 条规定的强制要约门槛，股东也可根据第
15 条提出自愿收购要约。但是，只有要约人收到的承诺所对应的股权与
在要约前或要约期间已经或同意被收购的股权的总和，能够使得该要约
人及其一致行动人在要约前或要约期间拥有公司 50%以上股权（或买方
要求的任何其他更高门槛）时，才满足该自愿要约生效的条件。
A voluntary offer must be made in cash, securities or a combination thereof, and
at a price not lower than the highest price paid by the offeror or persons acting
in concert with it for the voting shares of the company subject to the offer before

The Competition Act 2004 of Singapore (“Singapore Competition Act”)
generally prohibits mergers that result in, or are likely to result in, a substantial
reduction of competition for goods or services in any relevant market of
Singapore. According to guidelines issued by the Competition and Consumer
Commission of Singapore (“CCCS”), in general, a prospective merger or
concentration of undertakings will not normally give rise to competition
concerns unless:
新加坡《2004 年竞争法》通常禁止导致或可能导致新加坡任何相关市场
内商品或服务竞争大幅减少的合并。根据新加坡竞争与消费者委员会
（Competition and Consumer Commission of Singapore,“CCCS”）发布的
指南，通常而言，预期的合并或经营者集中通常不会导致竞争问题，除
非其涉及：
(1) the market share of the entities involved in the merger is 40% or more; or
参与合并的实体市场份额为 40%或以上；或者
(2) the entities involved in the merger have a market share of 20% to 40% and
their pre-merger market concentration (CR3127) is 70% or more.
参与合并的实体市场份额在 20%至 40%，并且其合并前的市场集中
度（CR3127）为70%以上。
At the same time, the CCCS has also stated that they would be unlikely to
investigate merger situations that only involve small companies, where (i) the
turnover in Singapore (i.e., Singapore-registered turnover as well as turnover
from Singaporean customers) exceeds S$5 million for the financial year
preceding the transaction; (ii) the aggregate worldwide turnover of the parties
for the financial year preceding the transaction exceeds S$50 million.
同时，CCCS 还表示，如果满足以下条件，则他们不太可能调查仅涉及
小公司的合并情况：（i）交易前一个财务年度在新加坡的营业额（即在
新加坡登记的营业额以及来自新加坡客户的营业额）超过 500 万新币；
（ii）交易前一个财务年度各方的全球总营业额超过 5000万新币。
Due to the voluntary filing approach, there are no penalties for failure to file in
a timely manner, but if the CCCS is satisfied after review that the operator has
intentionally, or through the existence of negligence, caused such merger to be
127 CR3 is an indicator used by CCCS to measure the degree of concentration in the relevant market(s)
and refers to the total market share held by the top three suppliers in the relevant market(s).
127 CR3是 CCCS用于衡量相关市场集中程度的指标，指相关市场中前三大供应商所占有的总市
场份额。

non-compliant with the provisions of the Singapore Competition Act, it will
impose a fine of not more than 10% of the turnover of the business of that
enterprise in Singapore for each year of infringement for a maximum of three
years on the competitors involved in the concentration, and may further require
the operator to dispose of shares, assets or business in such manner as directed
by the CCCS.
由于采取自愿申报的方式，因此未能及时申报的企业并不会受到处罚，
但是如果 CCCS 审核后认为经营者故意或由于存在过失而导致该等合并
不符合《竞争法》规定，将对参与集中的竞争者就每年的侵权行为处以
不超过该企业在新加坡业务营业额 10%的罚款，最长可达三年，并可进
一步要求经营者按照 CCCS指示的方式处置股份、资产或业务。
2. Disclosure requirements for holdings of or changes in interests in shares
股份权益持有或权益变化的披露要求
Changes in the interests in shares of a listed company held by a substantial
shareholder or director as a result of the purchase or sale of shares of the listed
company shall be disclosed in accordance with the provisions of the law.
因大股东、董事买卖上市公司股份，造成其持有的上市公司股份权益变
化的，应当按照法律规定进行披露。
Part 7 of the Singapore Securities and Futures Act sets out the requirements for
disclosure of interests in companies, which includes the obligation to disclose
holdings of interests or changes in interests as a result of the purchase or sale of
shares.
《证券及期货法》第 7 部分规定了公司权益披露要求，其中包括因股份
的购买或出售造成的权益持有或权益变化披露义务。
2.1 Disclosure of changes in shareholding interests of substantial shareholders
大股东股份权益变化的披露
2.1.1 Persons who become substantial shareholders or cease to be substantial
shareholders (who were substantial shareholders)
成为大股东或不再为大股东（曾为大股东）的人士
Sections 135 and 137 of the Singapore Securities and Futures Act provide that
a substantial shareholder or a person who has ceased to be a substantial
shareholder must give written notice to the company of the particulars of the
holding or change in one or more of the interests in the company in which they
293

《履行持续义务：主要证券交易所上市公司手册》
hold or used to hold voting shares and of the nature and extent of such interest.
《证券及期货法》第 135 条、第 137 条规定，大股东或不再为大股东的
人士必须向公司发出书面通知，说明其在该公司持有或曾持有拥有表决
权的股份的中的一项或多项权益的持有或变化详情，以及该等权益的性
质和范围。
The said written notice must be in the form and contain the information
prescribed by the MAS and be provided within 2 business days (even if the
person is no longer a substantial shareholder within 2 days) from the date on
which the substantial shareholder becomes aware that they have become a
substantial shareholder or the person who was a substantial shareholder
becomes aware that they are no longer a substantial shareholder.
上述书面通知必须采取 MAS 规定的形式，并包含 MAS 规定的信息，在
大股东知道其成为大股东，或曾为大股东的人士知道其不再为大股东之
日起2个工作日内（即使2日内又变成不再是大股东）提供。
“Substantial shareholder” means a person or entity holding an interest in 5% or
more of any class of voting shares of a listed company.
“大股东”是指持有上市公司 5%或以上任何类别有投票权股份的权益的
个人或实体。
The MAS has clarified that if a shareholder makes multiple transactions on the
same day, disclosure is only required in relation to the particular transaction that
triggers the notification obligation.
MAS 表明，如果股东在同一天内进行了多笔交易，只需要就触发通知义
务的特定交易进行披露。
For example, if a substantial shareholder disposes of voting shares of a listed
company several times on the same day, as follows:
例如，假设一个大股东在同一天内多次处理上市公司的有表决权的股份，
如下所示：
Shareholding (%)

The substantial shareholder will be required to make disclosures in relation to
transactions 2 and 4 because they had a disclosure obligation under Sections
135 (becoming a substantial shareholder) and 137 (i.e., ceasing to be a
substantial shareholder) of the Singapore Securities and Futures Act in relation
to transactions 2 and 4 respectively. They could not aggregate the total changes
and claim that they were not under a disclosure obligation because the
shareholder’s shareholding on that day changed from 4.55% before transaction
1 to 4.83% by the end of transaction 4.
大股东将被要求就交易2和4进行信息披露，因为根据《证券及期货法》
第 135条（成为大股东）和第 137条（即不再为大股东），他分别对交易
2和 4承担了披露义务。他不能因当日的持股比例从交易 1的 4.55%变为
交易4的 4.83%而将总体变化相加并主张自己没有披露义务。
2.1.2 Other changes in equity
其他权益变化
Section 136 of the Singapore Securities and Futures Act stipulates that in the
event of a change in the interest of a substantial shareholder in the voting shares
of a company or in the percentage level of the interest, such substantial
shareholder must notify the company in writing of such change within two
working days after they become aware of the change. The said written
notification must be in the form prescribed by MAS and contain the information
as prescribed by MAS.
《证券及期货法》第 136 条规定，大股东在公司有表决权股份中的权益
或权益的百分比水平发生变化的，该大股东必须在其得知该变化后的 2
个工作日内以书面形式通知该公司。上述书面通知必须采取 MAS规定的
形式，并包含 MAS规定的信息。

immediately before or immediately after the relevant time, as applicable, to the
following:
“百分比水平”，就公司大股东而言，是指紧接相关时间之前或紧接相
关时间之后（视情况而定），通过表示大股东拥有权益的所有有表决权的
股份所附票数确定的百分比数字，占以下股份中的总票数的百分比：
(1) all voting shares (excluding treasury shares) of the company; or
公司的所有有表决权的股份（不包括库存股）；或者
(2) if the share capital of the company is divided into 2 or more classes of
shares, all voting shares (excluding treasury shares) in the relevant class.
如果公司的股本分为 2 个或 2 个以上类别的股份，则相关类别中的
所有有表决权的股份（不包括库存股）。
2.1.3 Maintenance of the register of substantial shareholders
大股东名册的保留
Section 137C of the Singapore Securities and Futures Act requires corporations
to keep a register of notices of holdings or changes in interests given by the
above substantial shareholders in the form of a register at its registered office in
Singapore. If there is no registered office in Singapore, it is kept at the
corporation’s principal place of business in Singapore. MAS may at any time
request for a copy of the register.
《证券及期货法》第 137C条规定，公司必须将上述大股东发出的权益持
有或权益变化通知以登记册的形式保存在其新加坡的注册办事处。如果
没有新加坡注册办事处，则保留在公司在新加坡的主要营业地点。MAS
可随时要求该登记册的复印件。
2.2 Disclosure of changes in directors’ or chief executive officers’ interests in
shares
董事或首席执行官股份权益变化的披露
Section 133 of the Singapore Securities and Futures Act stipulates that a director
or chief executive officer of a company must give written notice to the company
setting out his or her interest in the shares of the company or its associated
companies and the nature and extent of the interest. Written notice must also be

holding securities, securities-related interests or changes in interests.

participants before listing may continue to be valid after listing (the shares
issued by the Hong Kong listing applicant in respect of such options and awards
are subject to the approval of the Hong Kong Stock Exchange for listing), but

the scheme after listing. The Hong Kong listing applicant is also required to
make full disclosure in the prospectus of the details of all options and awards
granted but not yet exercised, the potential dilutive effect of such options on the
shareholding after the listing of the company, and the effect of the shares that
can be issued in respect of such options or awards on the earnings per share.

calculated with reference to the total number of issued shares of the subsidiaries.
The “option exercise price” requirement does not apply to share option schemes
of a subsidiary of a Hong Kong listed company if the shares of the subsidiary
are not listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange. However, the scheme must
provide that the exercise price of options granted after the Hong Kong listed
company has resolved to seek a separate listing of the subsidiary and up to the
date of listing of the subsidiary must not be lower than the new issue price (if
any). In particular, any options granted during the period from six months prior
to the lodgment of the formal listing application form to the date of listing of
the subsidiary are subject to this requirement. Accordingly, the scheme must
therefore provide for any necessary adjustment of the exercise price of options
granted during such period to not lower than the new issue price.
除“授予期权或奖励的时间限制”及“未归属股份的表决权”外，上述
有关涉及香港上市公司发行新股的上市后股权激励计划/员工持股计划的
规定亦同样适用于涉及香港上市公司的主要附属公司新股或现有股份的
股权激励计划/员工持股计划。当中计划授权限额、服务提供商分项限额、

予的限额，一概参照附属公司的已发行股份总数计算。假如香港上市公
司附属公司的股份并非在香港联交所上市，“期权行使价”的规定不适
用于该附属公司的股份期权计划。然而，计划必须规定，在香港上市公
司已议决寻求将该附属公司分拆上市后直至附属公司上市之日止期间授
予的期权，其行使价不得低于新发行价（如有）。尤其是，在提交正式上
市申请表格前六个月直至附属公司上市之日止期间授出的期权尤其须遵
守此项规定。因此，计划必须订明，在此期间所授予期权的行使价可在
有需要时作出调整，确保不会低于新发行价。
A “principal subsidiary” refers to a subsidiary whose revenue, profits or total
assets accounted for 75% (or more) of that of the Hong Kong listed company
under the percentage ratios in any of the latest three financial years.136
“主要附属公司”指在最近三个财政年度中任何一年收入、利润或总资

United States
美股
1. “Safe harbor” rule: Rule 10b-18
“安全港”规则：10b-18规则 (Rule 10b-18)
Most of the share repurchases by a US listed company are decided by its
management and executed by its employee, therefore, a US listed company may
probably face two potential legal obstacles when repurchasing its own shares.
The first is insider trading restrictions. A US listed company itself is a company
with legal personality, which means it is regarded as an insider. If it repurchases
its own shares while in the possession of significant insider information, it may
constitute an insider trading. The second is restrictions relating to the prohibition
of market manipulation. Since a company’s repurchase of its shares in the open
market is often accomplished by a series of transactions, and the results of which
may affect the market price of the shares, as a result, it may give rise to
suspicions of market manipulation. For example, a company may buy a large
number of its shares before the announcement of favorable news (e.g., a merger
or acquisition that may lead to an increase in the share price) or suspend the
repurchase of its shares before the announcement of unfavorable news that may
lead to a decrease in the share price. Therefore, considering the risk that share
repurchases by listed companies may be regarded as insider trading and market
manipulation, share repurchases by listed companies were not common before
1982. However, the SEC enacted Rule 10b-18 in 1982, which provides a “safe
harbor” for US listed companies or their affiliates to repurchase shares.
美国上市公司回购股份大多基于管理层的决策，并由公司内部员工执行，
因此美国上市公司回购自身股票主要可能面临两类法律障碍，一是有关
内幕交易的限制，美国上市公司自身作为具有法律人格的公司，也属于
内幕人士之一，如果在拥有重大内幕信息的情况下回购自己的股票，可
能构成内幕交易；二是有关禁止操纵市场的规定，由于公司在公开市场
回购股票往往会以一系列的交易来完成，而其结果又会影响股票的市场
价格，因而可能会存在操纵市场的嫌疑。比如，公司可能在利好消息公
布前（比如可能导致股价上升的并购事件）大举买入公司股票，或在可
能导致股价下跌的不利消息公布前暂停回购股票。因此，考虑到上市公
司回购股票存在被认定为内幕交易和操纵市场的风险，在 1982 年之前美
国上市公司回购股份的操作并不常见，但 SEC 于 1982 年制定了 10b-18
规则（Rule 10b-18），为美国上市公司及其关联方回购股份提供了“安全

港”（Safe Harbor）。
1.1 Conditions for the application of Rule 10b-18
10b-18规则的适用条件
The risk that a US listed company’s share repurchase would be in violation of
the law, and, in particular, the risk of being perceived as market manipulation
(i.e., a violation of Sections 9(a)(2), 10(b), and Rule 10b-5 of the US Securities
Exchange Act), would be greatly reduced if the repurchase satisfies the
following transaction conditions:
如果一项回购同时满足以下交易条件，美国上市公司回购股份的违法风
险，尤其是被视为操纵市场（即违反《美国证券交易法》第 9a-2 条、第
10b条以及 10b-5规则）的风险将大大降低：
(1) Repurchase manner. US listed companies or their affiliates may bid for or
purchase their shares through a single broker or dealer per day. This
requirement is designed to avoid extensive trading of securities by US
listed companies by utilizing multiple brokers or dealers to repurchase
shares.
回购方式。美国上市公司及其关联方每天只能通过一个经纪人或交
易商来竞标或购买其股票，这一要求是为了避免美国上市公司利用
多个经纪人或交易商回购股票而导致证券广泛交易。
(2) Repurchase timing. US listed companies or their affiliates may not
repurchase their shares within the following time periods:
回购时间。美国上市公司及其关联方不得在以下时间内进行回购：
(a) For shares with an ADTV of US$1 million or more and a public
float of US$150 million or more within the 4 weeks prior to the

10分钟内进行回购；
(b) For other shares, repurchases must not be made at the opening of

the market and within 30 minutes prior to the close of the trading
session in the principal market or 30 minutes prior to the close of
the trading session in the market in which the repurchase is proposed
to be made.
对于其他股票，不得在开盘时以及在主要市场交易结束前的
30 分钟内或拟进行回购的市场交易结束之前的 30 分钟内进行
回购。
(3) Repurchase volume. US listed companies or their affiliates may not, on
any single day, repurchase more than 25% of the ADTV within the
preceding 4 weeks. Alternatively, US listed companies or their affiliates
may engage in one block trade per week, and the repurchase quantity of
such block trade is not subject to the above mentioned 25% limitation,
provided that the US public companies and their affiliates may not engage
in any other repurchase transactions pursuant to Rule 10b-18 on that day.
交易数量。美国上市公司及其关联方在任一天内回购股票的数量不
得超过前四周内ADTV的25%。或者，美国上市公司及其关联方每
周可进行一次大宗交易，该大宗交易的回购数量不受前述 25%的限
制，但前提是美国上市公司及其关联方在当日不得根据10b-18规则
进行其他回购交易。
(4) Repurchase price. The repurchase price of US listed companies and their
affiliates may not exceed the higher of the highest independent bid prior
to the repurchase or the last reported independent transaction price in the
consolidated system prior to the repurchase. The purpose of this
requirement is to prevent listed companies from inflating their share prices
through repurchases to levels that cannot be sustained by independent
market forces.
回购价格。美股发行人或其关联方的回购价格不得高于回购前最高
的独立投标报价或者回购前报价系统中最后报告的独立交易价格
（两者孰高）。该要求的目的是为了防止上市公司通过回购哄抬股
价，将股价抬高至独立市场力量无法维持的水平。
It must be noted that repurchases of shares by US listed companies or their
affiliates after a market-wide trading suspension are not subject to the
abovementioned trading volume limitations (i.e., US listed companies or their
affiliates may repurchase up to 100% of the ADTV within the preceding 4 weeks
per day after a market-wide trading suspension). In addition, repurchases by US
383
--- Page 392 (Text) ---
Meeting Continuing Obligations:
A Handbook for Companies Listed on Major Stock Exchanges
《履行持续义务：主要证券交易所上市公司手册》
listed companies or their affiliates following a market-wide trading suspension
are not subject to the foregoing repurchase time limitations if the repurchases
occur (a) from the reopening of trading until the scheduled close of trading on
the day that the suspension is imposed, or (b) from the opening to the close of
trading on the next trading day if a market-wide trading suspension was
triggered at the close of trading on the previous trading day.
需要注意的是，美股发行人或其关联方在市场整体停盘后回购股份则不
受前述交易数量的限制，即美股发行人或其关联方在市场整体停盘后每
日最高可回购前四周内ADTV的100%。另外，在市场整体停盘后，美股
发行人或其关联方在如下期间内的回购不受前述回购时间的限制：（a）
从恢复交易到停盘当日预定的收盘时间内，或（b）如果前一交易日收盘
时触发整体停盘，则自下一个交易日开盘到收盘期间内。
1.2 Application Scope of Rule 10b-18
10b-18规则的适用范围
Generally, repurchases of shares by US listed companies or their affiliates
through the open market are protected by Rule 10b-18, but the following off-
market repurchases may present a risk of stock price manipulation and are
therefore exempt from the application of Rule 10b-18: (a) repurchases made by
an employee stock ownership platform or for the purpose of an employee
incentive plan; (b) repurchases of fractional interest; or (c) repurchases made in
connection with a merger, acquisition, or similar transaction.
一般而言，美国上市公司或其关联方通过公开市场回购股份是受到 10b-
18 规则保护的，但是下列非公开市场回购由于可能存在操纵股票价格的
风险而不适用 10b-18 规则：（a）由员工持股平台进行回购或为员工激励
计划而进行的回购；（b）回购部分权益（fractional interest）；或（c）因
并购或类似交易而进行的回购。
It is also important to note that Rule 10b-18 applies only to repurchases of
ordinary shares or equivalent interests (such as units of beneficial interest in
trusts, limited partnerships or depositary shares) by US listed companies or their
affiliates, and does not apply to repurchases of preferred shares, convertible
debentures, warrants, options, or securities and futures products.
另外需要注意的是，10b-18 规则仅适用于美国上市公司或其关联方回购
普通股或同等权益（如信托、有限合伙或存托股份中的受益权益单位），
不适用于回购优先股、可转债、认股权证、期权或证券期货产品。

2. Other regulatory requirements for share repurchases
股份回购的其他监管要求
2.1 Rule 10b-5
10b-5规则
Rule 10b-18 provides a safe harbor for repurchases of shares by US listed
companies or their affiliates in the open market, but does not exempt them from
other insider trading and anti-fraud requirements under the US securities laws.
For example, issuers repurchasing shares through a share repurchase program
pursuant to Rule 10b5-1 will still have to satisfy the relevant filing obligations
(please see paragraph 1.4 Insider trading safe harbor (Rule 10b5-1) of Part I:
Composition and Disclosure of Inside Information – United States for details).
10b-18 规则为美国上市公司及其关联方通过公开市场回购股份提供了安
全港规则，但并未豁免美国证券法律规则下针对内幕交易和反欺诈的其
他要求，比如，发行人根据 10b5-1 规则通过股份回购计划回购股份仍需
满足相关的申报义务，具体请见上文（第一部分内幕消息的构成及披露–
美股）第 1.4段内幕交易安全港（Rule 10b5-1）。
Notably, according to the SEC’s October 15, 2020 announcement140 , it has
settled charges against various interested parties in connection with the alleged
failure of a US listed company to establish reasonable controls to ensure that the
company was not permitted to repurchase while it held MNPI. In this case the
listed company’s policy expressly prohibited the company from repurchasing
while in possession of MNPI, and the board of directors’ approval of the share
buyback plan was also contingent on such policy being satisfied. However, the
company failed to implement the relevant internal controls and to provide
reasonable assurance that the repurchases complied with the policy. As such, it
had to face charges. With regards to this case, Stephanie Avakian, Director of
the SEC’s Division of Enforcement, said, “[c]ompanies must have reasonable
controls in place to ensure buybacks are made in accordance with management’s
authorization.” It is clear that US listed companies should also have reasonable
and effective internal controls in place to monitor and ensure that repurchases
are legally compliant.
值得注意的是，根据SEC于2020年10月15日发布的公告140，其已就某
美国上市公司涉嫌未能建立合理控制措施以确保该公司在持有 MNPI 时

不得回购的指控与各相关方达成和解——本案中，涉案上市公司的政策
明确禁止公司在拥有 MNPI 的情况下进行回购，且董事会对回购方案的
批准也是以满足该政策为前提，但该公司未能实施相关内控措施，合理
保证回购符合该政策，因而面临指控。对此，SEC 执法司司长 Stephanie
Avakian 表示：“公司必须制定合理的控制措施，以确保回购符合管理层
的授权。”可见，美国上市公司还应制订合理有效的内控措施，对回购
的合法合规性进行监督和保证。
2.2 Regulation M
条例 M
Rule 102 of Regulation M imposes a restriction on US listed companies and
their affiliates from repurchasing the same class of shares during the distribution
period of shares (i.e., the issuer and its affiliates may not repurchase the same
class of shares or other securities convertible into the same class of shares from
the business day prior to the date on which the distribution price is determined
to the closing date of the distribution).
条例 M 的 102 规则（Rule 102）规定了美国上市公司及其关联方在“派
股”（distribution）期间回购同一类别股份的限制，即在派股价格确定前
一个工作日起至派股结束的期间内，发行人及其关联方不得回购同一类
别股份或可转换为同一类别股份的其他证券。
A “distribution” in this context includes not only a conventional public offering,
but also includes the issuance of shares in a merger and acquisition or a share
swap transaction, and even the sale of the listed company’s shares by its
substantial shareholder may constitute a “distribution”.
此处的“派股”不仅包括传统意义上的公开发行，也包括在并购或换股
交易中派发股份，甚至发行人的大股东出售上市公司股份也可能构成“派
股”。
2.3 Limitations on equity repurchases under US state laws
各州法律对股权回购的限制
It should be noted that in addition to the above federal law requirements, the
laws of each US state may have further restrictions on share repurchases by US
listed companies. For example, under Section 160 of the Delaware General
Corporation Law, in order to prevent share repurchases from impairing a
company’s capital, a Delaware corporation may only participate in share
repurchases by utilizing the company’s “surplus” (i.e., the difference between
386
--- Page 395 (Text) ---
Meeting Continuing Obligations:
A Handbook for Companies Listed on Major Stock Exchanges
《履行持续义务：主要证券交易所上市公司手册》
the company’s net assets on its accounts and its capital) to repurchase shares. If
the funds used for the repurchase exceeds the company’s surplus, the directors
who authorized such repurchases may be subject to liability. In addition,
Sections 500 to 509 of the California Corporations Code stipulate that the
payment of dividends to shareholders and the repurchase of shares are subject
to the relevant restrictions, i.e. an issuer may repurchase shares only if: (a) the
amount of retained earnings of the corporation prior to the repurchase exceeds
the sum of the amount of the repurchase and the undistributed preferred stock
dividends; or (b) the amount of the company’s assets after the repurchase
exceeds the sum of its liabilities and the undistributed preferred stock dividends.
需要注意的是，除了上述联邦法律要求外，各州法律对于美国上市公司
股份回购可能有进一步的限制，例如，根据《特拉华州普通公司法》
（Delaware General Corporation Law）第160条的要求，为防止股份回购
对公司股本的减损，特拉华州公司只能利用公司“溢余”（Surplus，即
公司会计净资产（Net Assets）与资本金（Capital）之间的差额）来参与
回购，用以回购的资金若超出公司溢余，则授权回购的董事可能面临相
应的赔偿责任。另外，加利福尼亚州公司法（California Corporations
Code）第 500 到 509 条要求公司向股东分红及回购股份需遵守相关的限
制，即发行人只能在满足下列条件的情况下方可实施回购：（a）回购前
公司的留存收益（retained earnings）超过回购金额与尚未分配的优先股
股息之和；或（b）回购后公司的资产金额超过其负债与尚未分配的优先
股股息之和。
Accordingly, it is recommended that US issuers should consult with outside
legal counsels regarding whether there is a need to comply with any US state
law restrictions prior to implementing a share repurchase program.
因此，建议美股发行人应在实施股票回购计划之前就是否需要遵守任何
州法律限制咨询外部法律顾问的意见。

1. Share repurchase by SGX Main Board listed company
主板上市公司股份回购
A share repurchase is a purchase by a company of its own shares, which it then
cancels or retains as treasury shares. Only the repurchased ordinary shares can
be held as treasury shares. The most common reason companies engage in share
repurchases is that they have capital that cannot be effectively utilized in their
business. Through share repurchases, a company can improve its earnings per
share (EPS)141 and return on equity (ROE)142, thereby improving its financial
ratios.
股份回购是指公司购买其自身股份，然后将其注销或作为库存股保留。
只有回购的普通股可以作为库存股。公司进行股份回购最常见的原因是
它们拥有无法有效运用于业务中的资金，通过股份回购提升公司的每股
收益（EPS）141和净资产收益率（ROE）142，从而提高财务比率。
Companies that undertake share buybacks and cancel or dispose of treasury
shares are required to file a Notice of Cancellation or Disposal of Treasury
Shares under S76K through ACRA’s Business Filing Portal (Bizfile+)143 .
公司如果进行股份回购，以及注销或处置库存股，需要通过 ACRA 的商
业备案门户网站（Bizfile+）提交“根据《公司法》第 76K 条取消或者处
置库存股的通知”（Notice of Cancellation or Disposal of Treasury Shares
under S76K）143。
Rule 882 of the SGX Main Board Rules and Rule 867 of the Catalist Board
Rules provides that share repurchases may only be made in the following
manner:
141 Earnings per share (EPS) is the ratio of a company’s net profit to its total equity and is an important
financial indicator used to measure a company’s profitability.
141 每股收益率（EPS）是指公司净利润与股本总数的比率，是用来衡量公司盈利能力的重要财
务指标。

As discussed in Part II, generally speaking, when shareholders and persons
acting in concert with them hold 30% or more of the voting rights of a company,
they are obliged to make a share offer to all other shareholders. However,
shareholders may be exempted from the obligation to make an offer through a
specific process if the increase in their voting rights is due to a share repurchase
by the company. Overall, exemptions need to be sought from other shareholders
during the approval process, while affected shareholders may need to abstain
from using their voting rights.
如第二部分所述，一般而言，当股东及其一致行动人持有公司有表决权
的股份达到 30%或以上时，他们就有义务向其他所有股东提出股份收购
要约。但如果其投票权的增加是因为公司进行了股份回购，则股东可以
通过特定的程序豁免提出要约的义务。总体来说，在审批过程中，需向
其他股东寻求豁免，同时受影响的股东可能需要放弃其投票权。

Hong Kong
港股
1. Contexts
背景
In its SFC Inside Information Guidelines, the SFC has issued guidelines for
Hong Kong listed companies on how to handle and respond to media
speculation, market rumors and analysts’ reports.
香港证监会于其出具《指引》中，对香港上市公司处理及应对传媒揣测、
市场谣传及分析员报告提出指引。
2. Do Hong Kong listed companies need to respond to media speculation and
market rumors?
香港上市公司是否需要对传媒揣测、市场谣传作出回应？
Hong Kong listed companies are generally under no obligation to respond to
media speculation, market rumors or analysts’ reports.
香港上市公司一般并无责任对传媒揣测、市场谣传或分析员报告作出响
应。
However, if a Hong Kong listed company has inside information and relies on
a safe harbor to withhold disclosure subject to the preservation of confidentiality,
the existence of media speculation, market rumors or analysts’ reports about the
Hong Kong listed company might indicate that matters intended to be kept
confidential have leaked. In particular, where media speculation, market rumors
or analysts’ reports are largely accurate and the information underlying the
speculation, rumors or reports constitutes inside information, it is likely that
confidentiality has been lost, thus the safe harbor falls away and public
disclosure is required. Accurate and extensive rumors and media speculation,
even where included in analysts’ reports, are unlikely to represent information
that is generally known and accordingly disclosure by the Hong Kong listed
company is necessary.
然而，如果香港上市公司有内幕消息并在保密原则的规限下援引安全港
条文暂不披露消息，则一旦出现有关香港上市公司的传媒揣测、市场谣
传或分析员报告，可能显示原拟保密的事项已外泄。尤其若传媒揣测、
市场谣传或分析员报告大致准确，而该等揣测、谣传或报告涉及的消息
构成内幕消息，该消息相当可能已不再保密，以致安全港条文不再适用。
399
--- Page 408 (Text) ---
Meeting Continuing Obligations:
A Handbook for Companies Listed on Major Stock Exchanges
《履行持续义务：主要证券交易所上市公司手册》
在这种情况下，香港上市公司必须作出公开披露。即使谣传及传媒揣测
准确及广泛流传，甚至载于分析员报告之内，亦不代表有关消息已普遍
为人所知，因此香港上市公司必须作出披露。
On the contrary, if a Hong Kong listed company does not have inside
information but media reports or market rumors carry false or untrue
information, the Hong Kong listed company is not obliged to make further
disclosure under the SFO. Notwithstanding the above, under the Hong Kong
Listing Rules, the Hong Kong Stock Exchange may require a Hong Kong listed
company to provide disclosure or clarification beyond that required by the SFO,
for example the issue of a negative announcement to confirm that a rumor is
false. The fact that the Hong Kong listed company issues an announcement as
requested by the Hong Kong Stock Exchange for the purposes of the Hong Kong
Listing Rules would not in itself imply that the Hong Kong listed company has
failed to meet the disclosure obligation for inside information under the SFO.
相反，如果香港上市公司并无内幕消息，但传媒报道或市场谣传载有虚
假或不实的资料，则香港上市公司无须根据证券及期货条例作出进一步
的披露。然而，根据香港上市规则，香港联交所可要求香港上市公司在
证券及期货条例的规定以外作出披露或澄清，例如发表否定公告，以确
认谣传失实。香港上市公司根据香港上市规则而应香港联交所要求发表
公告，并不代表香港上市公司未能履行根据证券及期货条例披露内幕消
息的责任。
If a Hong Kong listed company wishes to respond to rumors, the Hong Kong
listed company should do so by making a formal announcement, rather than
making a remark to a single publication or by way of a press release. This will
ensure that the whole market is equally and properly informed.
香港上市公司如要对谣传作出响应，应刊发正式公告，而不是对单一份
刊物发表意见或以新闻稿的形式响应，以确保以平等及适当的方式向整
个市场发出通知。
3. How should Hong Kong listed companies respond to and review analyst
reports?
香港上市公司应如何回应及审阅分析员报告?
Hong Kong listed companies should never selectively release inside information
to analysts, investors or journalists. A Hong Kong listed company should ensure
that no inside information is given when answering an analyst’s questions or
reviewing an analyst’s draft report. It is inappropriate for a question to be
400
--- Page 409 (Text) ---
Meeting Continuing Obligations:
A Handbook for Companies Listed on Major Stock Exchanges
《履行持续义务：主要证券交易所上市公司手册》
answered, or draft report corrected, if doing so involves providing inside
information. When analysts visit the Hong Kong listed company, care should be
taken to ensure they do not obtain inside information.
香港上市公司绝不可向分析员、投资者或记者选择性发放内幕消息。香
港上市公司回答分析员的问题或审阅分析员的报告草拟本时，应确保不
会提供内幕消息。回答问题或订正报告草拟本的过程中，不应涉及提供
内幕消息。分析员造访香港上市公司期间，香港上市公司应小心确保分
析员不会取得内幕消息。
In some circumstances, a Hong Kong listed company does not have inside
information but an analyst’s report contains errors or misinterpretations by, for
example, using out of date data, or misreading or misinterpreting historical
information of the Hong Kong listed company especially where the Hong Kong
listed company’s business is complex and/or comprised of many different
divisions. In such cases, unless the Hong Kong listed company knows of inside
information relevant to the analyst’s report which has not been disclosed, strictly
speaking the Hong Kong listed company is not obliged to make a correction or
clarification under the SFO. It may nevertheless be appropriate, as a matter of
good practice, for the Hong Kong listed company to clarify historical
information and correct any factual errors in the analyst’s assumptions which
are significant to the extent that they may mislead the market, provided any
clarification is confined to drawing the analyst’s attention to information that
has already been made available to the market. If the Hong Kong listed company
becomes aware of inside information that would correct a fundamental
misconception in the report, public disclosure of such information would be
necessary. Nonetheless, a Hong Kong listed company is under no legal
obligation to track reports prepared by third parties.
在某些情况下，香港上市公司并无内幕消息，但有分析员报告因例如误
用过时的数据或错误理解或错误诠释香港上市公司的过往数据而载有错
误或误解（尤其是当香港上市公司的业务复杂及/或包含多种不同板块）。
在此情况下，除非香港上市公司知道与该分析员报告有关而尚未披露的
内幕消息，否则严格来说证券及期货条例并无规定香港上市公司须作出
纠正或澄清。然而，作为良好的常规操作，若过往资料及分析员所用的
假设出现任何严重事实错误而可能对市场造成误导，香港上市公司或宜
予以澄清及纠正，但任何澄清应仅限于向分析员指出已向市场公布的资
料。香港上市公司若得悉任何内幕消息可以纠正报告内的基本错误观念，

United States
美股
Gun jumping refers to US issuers’ violation of restrictions on issuers/listed company
communications and publicity imposed by the US Securities Act. Based on the different
levels of communication restrictions with the public during the listing process, public
communication and publicity activities during the listing process can generally be
divided into 3 distinct periods: the quiet period, the waiting period, and the post-
effective period.
抢跑（Gun Jumping）是指美股发行人违反《美国证券法》规定的上市公司交流
与宣传限制的行为。根据美股发行人在上市过程中与公众交流限制的程度不同，
大致能将上市过程中的公众交流及宣传划分为静默期、等待期以及注册生效后
时期的3个不同的时期。
1. Quiet period
静默期
1.1 General limitations on communication and publicity during quiet period
静默期内交流与宣传的一般限制
A “quiet period” is the period from the time a company resolves to go public
and hires an investment bank, until the time its prospectus is publicly filed with
the SEC. During the quiet period, a US issuer is prohibited to “offer to sell” the
company’s securities, in writing or orally, other than by holding a TTW (testing-
the-water) meeting146. The SEC has broadly interpreted the term “offer to sell”
to mean that even communications that do not involve an offer but may
stimulate interest in the issuer constitute an “offer to sell”. For example, a US
issuer may issue press releases about the company’s prospects and earnings
expectations, or may issue similar publications or hold conferences for the
investment community and potential stock purchasers.
“静默期”是指从公司决议公开发行上市并且聘请投行之日起，至向
SEC 公开递交招股书之前的时期。在静默期内，除举行 TTW（testing-
the-water）会议 146 外，美股发行人不得以任何书面或口头形式“要约销
售”公司的证券。SEC 对“要约销售”一词进行广义解释，即使不涉及
146 That is, communications with qualified institutional investors or other institutional accredited
investors to test their interest in the proposed offering.
146 即与合格机构投资者（Qualified Institutional Investors）或其他认可机构投资者（Institutional
Accredited Investors）的交流，以测试其对拟议发行的兴趣。
403
--- Page 412 (Text) ---
Meeting Continuing Obligations:
A Handbook for Companies Listed on Major Stock Exchanges
《履行持续义务：主要证券交易所上市公司手册》
要约内容但可能激发投资者对发行人兴趣的交流也可能构成“要约销
售”。比如，美股发行人发布有关于公司前景、收益预期的新闻稿，或
面向投资团体、潜在股票购买者发布类似的出版物或举行相关会议等。
1.2 Exceptions to restrictions on communication and publicity during the quiet
period
静默期内交流与宣传限制的例外
1.2.1 Safe harbor rules for Rule 163A (Rule 163A)
163A规则 (Rule 163A)的安全港规则
SEC Rule 163A provides that public communications made by a company more
than 30 days prior to the public filing of a registration statement is not
considered to constitute gun jumping, provided that the following conditions are
met:
根据 SEC 制订的 163A 规则，在满足以下条件的前提下，公司在公开提
交注册声明之前超过 30天进行的公众宣传不视为抢跑：
(a) the communications do not involve the offering of securities;
交流内容不涉及股票发行；
(b) such communication must be made by the issuer or its authorized
representatives; and
该等交流必须由发行人或经其授权的代表进行；以及
(c) the company is required to take reasonable steps within its control to
prevent further redistribution and publication of such communicated
information within 30 days prior to the filing of the registration statement.
公司需在其控制范围内采取合理措施，以防止在注册声明提交前 30
天内该等公众宣传内容进一步再传播、发布。
1.2.2 Rule 135
135规则
SEC Rule 135 provides that a company’s announcement of a proposed public
offering is not considered to be an “offer”, but its public announcement may
only include information of:
根据 SEC 制订的 135 规则，公司宣布拟议公开发行的行为不被视为“要
约”，但其公开宣布的信息仅能包括：
404

(a) the issuer’s name;
发行人名称；
(b) the title, amount and basic terms of the securities to be offered;
拟发行证券的名称、金额和基本条款；
(c) the anticipated timing of the offering; and
拟发行的时间；以及
(d) a brief description of the manner and purpose of the offering, provided
that the name and other information of the underwriter is not allowed to
be mentioned.
对发行方式和目的的简要说明，但不得提及承销商名称。
1.2.3 Rule 169
169规则
SEC Rule 169 provides a safe harbor for companies to publish factual business
information that is not-forward-looking information. For example, a company
may continue to publish factual information about the company, factual business
and financial information, or advertisements about the company’s products or
services. However, Rule 169 applies only to communications and publicity
intended for a company’s customers, suppliers, and other recipients of
information who are not investors. The SEC has also made clear, however, that
Rule 169 will continue to apply if the recipient of the information happens to be
both a customer of the company and an investor.
SEC 制订的 169 规则为公司发布非预测性 （not-forward-looking
information）的事实业务信息（factual business information）提供了安全
港。比如，公司可以继续发布关于公司的实际信息、业务和财务事实信
息或者公司产品或服务的广告。但是，169规则仅适用于针对公司客户、
供应商以及其他非投资者身份的信息接收者所作的交流与宣传。但 SEC
也明确表示，如果信息接收者恰好既是公司客户又是投资者，169规则将
继续适用。
2. Waiting period
等待期
2.1 General restrictions on communication and publicity during the waiting
period
405
--- Page 414 (Text) ---
Meeting Continuing Obligations:
A Handbook for Companies Listed on Major Stock Exchanges
《履行持续义务：主要证券交易所上市公司手册》
等待期内交流与宣传的一般限制
The “waiting period” is the period from the date an issuer publicly files a
registration statement with the SEC until the SEC declares the registration
statement effective. During the waiting period, a US issuer may offer to sell its
securities orally (e.g., by conducting a road show to prospective investors
describing the US issuer’s actual business, industry trends, and reasons for
going public, so as to enable prospective investors to ask questions directly to
the US issuer’s management) or communicate with investors through a
preliminary prospectus (i.e., a red herring), but may not use any other written
materials except the preliminary prospectus and may not sell securities. After a
preliminary prospectus is filed, companies often publicly announce the IPO
through a press release and inform potential investors of how to obtain the
preliminary prospectus.
“等待期”是指从公司向 SEC公开递交注册声明之日起，至 SEC宣布注
册声明生效之前的时期。在等待期内，美股发行人可以通过口头方式要
约销售证券（如向潜在投资者路演，介绍美股发行人实际业务、行业趋
势、上市原因，潜在投资者可直接向美股发行人管理层提问），或通过初
步招股书（即 Red Herring，红鲱鱼招股书）和投资者沟通，但不能使用
除了初步招股书之外的任何其他书面材料，且不得销售证券。在初步招
股书提交后，公司往往通过新闻稿公开宣布 IPO 并告知潜在投资者初步
招股书的获取途径。
2.2 Exceptions to communication and publicity restrictions during the waiting
period
等待期内交流与宣传限制的例外
SEC Rule 134 provides a safe harbor for US issuers to publicly release certain
specified written materials (e.g., in the form of press releases, e-mails, website
postings) after the filing of a preliminary prospectus, and the information
permitted to be provided by a US issuer under Rule 134 includes:
SEC制订的 134规则（Rule 134）为美股发行人在递交初步招股书后公开
发布某些特定的书面材料（如新闻稿、电子邮件、网站帖子的形式）提
供了安全港，134规则下允许美股发行人提供的信息包括：
(a) basic factual information such as the identity of the issuer, place of
business and contact information;
发行人身份、营业地点及联系方式等基础事实性信息；
406

对发行人业务大致分类的简要介绍（仅限于发行人产品的大致分类
等）；
(d) the price of the security or the method for determining price (in the case
of an IPO, limited to publication after the price range prospectus is made

股价或确定股价的方式（就首次公开发行而言，仅限于在价格区间
招股书（price range prospectus）公开后公布）；
(e) in the case of an offering of fixed-income securities, the maturity date,
interest rate, and yield (in the case of an IPO, limited to publication after
the price range prospectus is made public);
就固定收益类证券的发行而言，到期日、利率、收益率（就首次公
开发行而言，仅限于在价格区间招股书（price range prospectus）公
开后公布）；
(f) the proposed use of proceeds (if disclosed in the published prospectus);
募集资金的拟议用途（如已公开的招股书中已披露）；
(g) the name, address, telephone number and e-mail address of the sender of
the communication and whether or not he or she is involved in the offering;
通讯发送人的姓名、地址、电话和电子邮件，以及其是否参与发行；
(h) the anticipated schedule for the offering and introduction to promotional
events;
预计发行时间表及宣传事件介绍；
(i) descriptions of the underwriters’ offering procedures, account opening,

(k) information such as the name of the exchange on which it is proposed to
be listed, the stock code, etc.; and
拟上市的交易所名称、股票代码等信息；以及
(l) a required legend.
必需的图例。
3. Post-effective period
注册生效后
Within 25 days upon the effective date of the SEC’s announcement of the
prospectus, underwriters will be required to file a final prospectus with the SEC
and may sell shares through the final prospectus. After the expiration of the
foregoing 25-day filing period, the issuer’s publicity and communications to the
public will not be subject to the relevant restrictions.
SEC宣布招股说明书生效之日起25天内，承销商需要向SEC提交最终招
股说明书，并可通过最终招股说明书销售股票。前述 25 天提交期结束后，
发行人对公众的宣传和交流将不受相关限制。
4. Consequences of gun jumping
实施抢跑行为的后果
If the SEC determines that an issuer has implemented gun jumping (i.e., violated
the communication and publicity restrictions during the time period described
above), it may require the company to delay the offering or to add a disclosure
in the registration statement regarding the company’s violation of Section 5 of
the US Securities Act. In addition, Section 12(a)(1) of the US Securities Act
provides investors who purchase stock in such transactions with a right of
rescission, which entitles the investor to demand that the company return the
purchase price paid or, if he or she no longer owns the company’s stock, the
difference between the purchase and the sale price of such securities.
如果 SEC 认定发行人实施了抢跑行为（即违反上述期限内的交流与宣传
限制），SEC 可要求该公司延迟发行或在注册声明中增加披露该公司违反
《美国证券法》第5条的相关情况。此外，《美国证券法》第12（a）(1）
条规定在该等交易中购买股票的投资者享有撤销权，投资者有权要求公
司返还其已支付的购买价款，或者若其不再持有公司股票，则有权要求
公司返还其购买股票与出售股票价款之间的差额。

5. Publicity and communications for listed companies
已上市公司的公开与宣传
With respect to listed companies, the SEC requires listed companies to file
current reports on Form 8-K (to disclose significant events), quarterly reports
on Form 10-Q, annual reports on Form 10-K, and proxy statements (to disclose
matters to be resolved at each shareholders meeting), which are available to the
public on the SEC’s website. In addition, the Regulation Fair Disclosure, which
was implemented in October 2000, further requires that if a US listed company
discloses any material non-public information to a particular group, it must
disclose the same information to the public at the same time. For intentional
selective disclosure, the US listed company must make a public disclosure
simultaneously with such selective disclosure. For unintentional selective
disclosure, the company should make a public disclosure as soon as reasonably
practicable (but no later than the later of 24 hours or the commencement of the
next day’s trading on the New York Stock Exchange) after a senior official of
the issuer becomes aware of the possibility of an unintentional selective
disclosure of material nonpublic information. In order to satisfy the foregoing
requirements, a listed company is required to file a Form 8-K with the SEC or
by other reasonable means that makes the relevant information broadly and non-
exclusively available to the public. Regulation Fair Disclosure does not define
“material nonpublic information”, but the prevailing view is that a listed
company should consider nonpublic information to be material if it would be
important to a reasonable investor in deciding whether to buy, sell or hold the
corresponding securities. The purpose of the Regulation Fair Disclosure is to
protect investors and enhance fairness by addressing the selective disclosure of
material information to market professionals as well as to certain shareholders
by listed companies before releasing the information to the public, thereby
giving them an informational and financial advantage over small or individual
investors.
就已上市公司而言，SEC 要求已上市公司须定期提交表格 8-K（Form 8-
K）披露重大事件的当前报告（Current Report）、表格10-Q的季度报告、
表格 10-K 的年度报告、以及包含在每次股东大会上进行决议的事项的代
理声明（Proxy Statements），公众可以自行在SEC的网站上查阅该等文件。
此外，SEC 于 2000 年 10 月开始实施的公平披露规则（Regulation Fair
Disclosure）进一步要求，若美国上市公司向特定集团披露任何重要非公
开信息的，美国上市公司必须同时向公众公开披露相同的信息。其中，
对于故意地选择性披露，美国上市公司必须在进行选择性披露的同时进
409
--- Page 418 (Text) ---
Meeting Continuing Obligations:
A Handbook for Companies Listed on Major Stock Exchanges
《履行持续义务：主要证券交易所上市公司手册》
行公开披露；对于非故意地选择性披露，在公司高管意识到可能存在重
要非公开信息的非故意选择性披露时，美国上市公司应在合理可行的情
况下尽快公开披露（但不得晚于 24 小时或纽约证券交易所次日交易开始
的时间，以较晚者为准）。为了满足前述要求，上市公司须向SEC提交8-
K 表格，或以其他广泛地、非排他地向公众提供相关信息的合理方式进
行披露。公平披露规则并未明确“重大非公开信息”的定义，但主流观
点认为，若该等非公开信息对于合理投资人决定是否购入、出售或持有
相应证券具有重要意义，则上市公司应当将其视为重大非公开信息。公
平披露规则的目的是为了应对上市公司在向公众发布信息之前有选择性
地向市场专业人士以及特定股东披露重要信息，从而使其在信息和财务
方面相比小额投资者或者个人投资者具备更大优势，并以此保护投资者
和最大限度地实现公平。
With respect to the clarification of rumors by listed companies, the SEC tends
to believe that listed companies have an obligation to disclose information to
clarify rumors so as not to adversely affect investment decisions. According to
the NYSE Listed Company Manual, close attentions need to be paid to the
market activities relating to the securities of a listed company when considering
the significant corporate matters of such listed company. If rumors or unusual
market activities indicate that information about impending developments has
leaked out, a frank and explicit announcement is clearly required. If rumors are
in fact false or inaccurate, they should be promptly denied or clarified. If rumors
are in fact true or developing, the listed company must immediately provide the
public with a candid statement of the situation directly and openly. Similarly,
under the Nasdaq Listing Rules, whenever unusual market activity occurs in a
Nasdaq company’s securities, the company should determine whether there is
material information or news that should be disclosed. If rumors or unusual
market activities indicate that information about impending developments have
become known to the investing public, or if information from sources other than
the listed company have become known to the investing public, the listed
company should clearly disclose such information. Public denial of false or
inaccurate rumors by a listed company is generally considered appropriate
under certain circumstances in order to avoid influencing the securities or
investment decisions to the listed company.
就已上市公司的谣言澄清，SEC 倾向于认为上市公司有义务披露信息以
澄清谣言，从而避免对投资决策产生不利的影响。根据《纽约证券交易
所上市公司手册》，在考虑上市公司重大公司事务时，应密切关注上市公

司证券的市场活动。如果谣言或异常的市场活动表明即将发生的事态发
展的信息已经泄露，上市公司应该发布明确坦诚的公告。如果谣言是虚
假或不准确的，则上市公司应及时予以否认或澄清。如果谣言属实或有
进展，则上市公司必须立即向公众坦诚地说明相关情况，并直接、公开
地作出声明；同样的，根据《纳斯达克上市规则》，当纳斯达克证券交易
所的上市公司的证券出现异常市场活动时，公司应确定是否存在应予披
露的重要信息或新闻。如果传言或不寻常的市场活动表明有关即将发生
的事态发展的信息已为投资公众所知，或如果来自上市公司以外的信息
来源已为投资公众所知，则上市公司应明确公开该等信息。在特定情况
下，为了避免对上市公司的证券或投资决策产生影响，上市公司公开否
认虚假或不准确的传言一般被认为属于适当的行为。

1. Introduction
介绍
The SGX RegCo has issued Practice Note 7.1 - Continuing Disclosure, which
provides guidance on the continuing obligation of issuers to disclose material
information and the SGX RegCo’s Corporate Disclosure Policy.
新交所已下发《实务指引 7.1——持续披露》，为发行人披露重大信息的
持续义务以及新交所的公司披露政策提供指引。
Rule 703(1) of the SGX Listing Rules requires an issuer to publish any
information known to the issuer concerning or any of its subsidiaries or
associated companies which is necessary to avoid the establishment of a false
market in the issuer’s securities (trade-sensitive information) or would be likely
to have a material affect on the price or value of the issuer’s securities
(materially price-sensitive information). See paragraph 1.2 Disclosure of inside
information of Part I: Composition and Disclosure of Inside Information –
Singapore for details.
上市规则第 703（1）条要求发行人公布其知道的有关发行人或其子公司、
联营公司的任何信息，如果这些信息对于避免在发行人的证券中建立虚
假市场（交易敏感信息）是必要的，或者可能会对发行人证券的价格或
价值产生重大影响（重大价格敏感信息）。具体内容见第一部分第 1.2 项。
2. Clarification or confirmation of rumors or reports
澄清或证实谣言或报告
The SGX RegCo generally does not expect issuers to respond to rumors or
speculation (including reports predicting future sales, earnings or other data)
unless there is a price or volume movement in the market.
除非市场出现价格或成交量变动，否则新交所一般不期望发行人对谣言
或猜测（包括预测未来销售、盈利或其他数据的报告）做出回应。
Public circulation of information, whether by an article published in newspaper,
by a broker’s market letter or by word-of-mouth, either correct or false, which
has not been substantiated by the issuer and which is likely to have, or has had,
an effect on the price of the issuer's listed securities or would be likely to have
a bearing on investment decisions must be clarified or confirmed promptly.
412

Meeting Continuing Obligations:

《履行持续义务：主要证券交易所上市公司手册》
公开传播的信息，无论是通过报纸上发表的文章、经纪人的市场信函还
是通过口头传播的信息，无论正确还是错误，如果这些信息未经发行人
证实，可能或已经证实对发行人上市证券价格产生影响或可能对投资决
策产生影响的，必须及时澄清或确认。
However, if a report or rumor contains information that is reasonably specific,
indicating that the information came from an insider or a reliable source, the
issuer should clarify its position. If a rumor suggests that material information
has been leaked, a frank and explicit announcement is required.
然而，如果报告或谣言中包含的信息相当具体，表明该信息来自内部人
士或可靠来源，则发行人应澄清立场。如果有传言表明重大信息泄露，
则需要提供坦诚、明确的公告。
3. Public dissemination
公开传播
Public disclosure of material information must be made by an announcement to
the Exchange via SGXNet. To facilitate the dissemination of information, copies
of announcements may be provided simultaneously to newspapers and
newswire services.
重大信息的公开披露必须通过 SGXNet 网站向新交所发布公告的方式进
行。为方便信息传播，公告副本可同时提供给报纸和新闻专线服务。
4. Publication of promotional materials
出版宣传品
Announcements on SGXNet must be balanced and fair. That is, both positive
and negative aspects of the development or prospect must be disclosed honestly
and without bias. Issuers should be cautious not to mislead investors with the
presentation or emphasis of certain favorable information or omitting certain
unfavorable key facts.
SGXNet上的公告必须均衡且公平。也就是说，关于发展或前景的积极和
消极方面都必须诚实且不带偏见地披露。发行人应谨慎行事，不要通过
陈述或强调某些有利信息或遗漏某些不利的关键事实来误导投资者。
Issuers should avoid using promotional jargon in their announcements. Issuers
should also avoid using the SGXNet to publish third party research reports that
present a favorable valuation of the issuer’s shares in order to drive up the share
price. The publication of a research reports by an issuer could be interpreted as
413
--- Page 422 (Text) ---
Meeting Continuing Obligations:
A Handbook for Companies Listed on Major Stock Exchanges
《履行持续义务：主要证券交易所上市公司手册》
a tacit representation that its results will be close to estimate and may be viewed
as a prospect statement by the SGX RegCo.
发行人应避免在公告中使用促销术语。发行人还应避免利用新交所发布
第三方研究报告，对发行人的股票提供有利的估值，以推高股价。发行
人发表研究报告可能会被理解为默认其业绩将接近预期，并可能被新交
所视为前景陈述。
5. Publication on the issuer’s website
在发行人网站发布信息
SGX RegCo does not prohibit issuers from disseminating information through
other media such as the Internet. Any material information released on the
Internet, including posting of information on its own website, should have been
previously released via SGXNet, or should be simultaneously released via
SGXNet.
新交所并不禁止发行人通过互联网等其他媒体传播信息。在互联网上发
布的任何重大信息，包括在其自己的网站上发布的信息，应事先或应通
过SGXNet同时发布。
6. Analyst briefing
分析师简报
The SGX RegCo does not prohibit issuers from conducting briefings with
analysts and holding meetings with investors and the media. However, such
meetings might create a perception that analysts, institutional investors, fund
managers or the media have access to information that is not generally available
to the public, which may undermine investor’s confidence in the existence of a
level playing field.
新交所并不禁止发行人与分析师分析简报，以及与投资者和媒体举行会
议。然而，这些会议可能会让人认为分析师、机构投资者、基金经理或
媒体可以获得公众一般无法获得的信息，这可能会削弱投资者对公平竞
争环境存在的信心。
The SGX RegCo X therefore recommends that issuers observe an “open door”
policy and have policies in place to minimize the risk of being perceived to be
practicing selective disclosure. Such policies might include pre-release of any
prepared information intended for briefings and meetings, such as slides or
presentations, via SGXNet. Alternatively, as such information must not be
material non-public information, it could be released on the issuer’s website
414
--- Page 423 (Text) ---
Meeting Continuing Obligations:
A Handbook for Companies Listed on Major Stock Exchanges
《履行持续义务：主要证券交易所上市公司手册》
with accompanying SGXNet announcement to inform investors that additional
information is available on the issuer’s website. The second alternative may be
preferred if the issuer intends to release large-sized files or provide webcasts of
briefings.
因此，新交所建议发行人遵守“门户开放”政策，制定政策以尽量减少
被视为选择性披露的风险。此类政策可能包括通过 SGXNet 预先发布为
简报和会议准备的任何信息，例如幻灯片或演讲。或者，由于此类信息
不得为重要的非公开信息，因此可以在发行人的网站上发布，并附上新
交所公告，以告知投资者发行人的网站上提供了更多信息。如果发行人
打算发布大型文件或提供简报的网络广播，则可能会首选第二种方案。
Where an issuer inadvertently discloses material, non-public information during
these briefings or meetings, the issuer must disseminate the information through
the SGXNet as promptly as possible. If necessary, request a trading halt in its
securities.
如果发行人在这些简报会或会议期间无意中披露了重大非公开信息，发
行人必须尽快通过新交所传播该信息。必要时，发行人可以要求其证券
停牌。

Part VI: HFCAA and PCAOB Developments and Disclosure
Requirements
第六部分：HFCAA 与 PCAOB 的发展动向及披露要求
1. Background and development of US-China audit co-operation
中美审计合作背景与发展历程
The Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act (“HFCAA”), which was first
proposed in March 2019 and came into effect in December 2020, requires
foreign private issuers not to be owned or controlled by foreign governments,
and requires foreign companies listed in the US to comply with the auditing
standards of the US Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (“PCAOB”),
the breach of which may cause potential delisting consequences to issuers. In
December 2021, the SEC issued amendments to the HFCAA specifying that
foreign private issuers that fail to meet the PCAOB’s inspection requirements
for accounting firms for 3 consecutive years will be prohibited from trading
their securities in the US.
《外国公司问责法案》（Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act，
“HFCAA”）最早于 2019 年 3 月被提出，于 2020 年 12 月正式生效，
HFCAA要求外国私人发行人不受外国政府拥有或控制，并要求在美国上
市的外国企业遵守美国公众公司会计监督委员会（Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board，“PCAOB”）的审计标准，否则可能面临
退市的后果。2021年 12月，SEC发布 HFCAA修正案，明确规定外国私
人发行人连续3年不能满足PCAOB对会计师事务所检查要求的，将禁止
其证券在美交易。
On June 22, 2021, the US Senate unanimously passed the Accelerating Holding
Foreign Companies Accountable Act. In December 2022, such Act officially
takes effect, which amends the aforementioned delisting period from 3 years to
2 years, which means that if a China-Based US-Listed Company fails to meet
the PCAOB’s audit requirements for 2 consecutive years, the SEC will prohibit
the company’s securities from trading on any US stock exchange, and the
company may face delisting consequences.
2021 年 6 月 22 日，美国参议院一致通过《加速外国公司问责法》
（Accelerating Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act），2022年12月，
该等法案正式生效，将前述退市期限从 3 年修改为 2 年。这意味着，如
果中概股上市公司连续2年不能满足PCAOB的审计要求，SEC将禁止该
416

Meeting Continuing Obligations:
A Handbook for Companies Listed on Major Stock Exchanges
《履行持续义务：主要证券交易所上市公司手册》
公司的证券在任何美国证券交易所进行交易，并且该公司将面临退市。
However, China’s existing laws, regulations and policies require that in the
process of listing a domestic company abroad, the working papers and other
files formed onshore should be stored onshore, and the foreign securities
regulatory authorities are not permitted to conduct investigations, evidence
collection and other activities directly in the territory of China.
然而，中国现行的法律法规和政策要求境内公司在境外上市过程中，在
境内形成的工作底稿等档案应当存放在境内，境外证券监督管理机构不
得在我国境内直接进行调查取证等活动。
In order to resolve the conflict between the US rule requirements on audit
working papers and China’s existing laws, regulations and policies, the US and
China have engaged in a long term negotiation on audit oversight co-operation.
On August 26, 2022, the CSRC, the Ministry of Finance of the People’s
Republic of China, and the PCAOB signed an audit oversight co-operation
agreement (the “US-China Audit Oversight Co-operation Agreement”),
reaching a preliminary consensus on cross-border audit regulation. On
December 15, 2022, the PCAOB issued a report summarizing the results of its
audit oversight of KPMG Huazhen LLP in mainland China and
PricewaterhouseCoopers in Hong Kong SAR. The report reverses the decision
issued by the PCAOB in December 2021 that it was unable to inspect and
investigate accounting firms located in mainland China and Hong Kong SAR.
The report also temporarily eliminated the risk of mandatory delisting of China-
Based US-Listed Company under the HFCAA. The execution of the US-China
Audit Oversight Co-operation Agreement and the report of PCAOB indicated
that China and the US have tentatively reached the consensus on cross-border
audit regulatory cooperation, and the delisting risk of China-Based US-Listed
Companies has been mitigated temporarily.
为解决美国方面对审计底稿的规则要求与中国现行的法律法规和政策间
存在的冲突，中美双方就审计监管合作的问题展开了长期的磋商。2022
年 8 月 26 日，中国证监会、中华人民共和国财政部与 PCAOB 签署了审
计监管合作协议（“中美审计监管合作协议”），中美两国监管部门就跨
境审计监管达成了初步共识。2022年12月15日，PCAOB发布报告总结
了其对中国内地毕马威华振会计师事务所和中国香港普华永道会计师事
务所的审计监督结果，该报告撤销了PCAOB在2021年12月所发布的认
为其无法审查位于中国内地/中国香港的会计师事务所的决定，也暂时消
除了 SEC 根据《外国公司问责法案》要求中概股上市公司强制退市摘牌
417

Meeting Continuing Obligations:

《履行持续义务：主要证券交易所上市公司手册》
的风险。无论是中美审计监管合作协议的签订，还是PCAOB报告，均表
明中美两国对跨境审计监管合作已暂时达成了一致，中概股上市公司的
退市风险暂获缓解。
2. Highlights of the US-China Audit Oversight Co-operation Agreement
审计监管合作协议重点内容
Although the original text of the US-China Audit Oversight Co-operation
Agreement is not publicly available, the principles of the US-China Audit
Oversight Co-operation Agreement are outlined in the CSRC press release, the
CSRC’s Q&A with reporters, and the US press release.
虽然中美审计监管合作协议的原文并未公开，但中国证监会新闻稿、中
国证监会答记者问、美方新闻稿等均对中美审计监管合作协议的原则进
行了简要介绍。
2.1 Scope of co-operation
合作范围
(1) China: Both China and the US may conduct inspections and investigations
of relevant accounting firms within the jurisdiction of the other party, and
the requested party shall endeavor to provide full assistance to the extent
permitted by law. In particular, the scope of assistance provided by the
China side also involves some Hong Kong firms that provide audit
services for China-Based US-Listed Companies whose audit working
papers are stored in the mainland China.
中方：中美双方均可对另一方辖区内相关会计师事务所开展检查和
调查，被请求方应在法律允许范围内尽力提供充分协助。其中，中
方提供协助的范围也涉及部分为中概股提供审计服务、且审计底稿
存放在内地的香港事务所。
(2) US: The PCAOB is entitled to full access to matters such as audit working
papers, auditor personnel and other information.
美方：PCAOB 有权获得审计工作文件、审计人员和其他信息等事
项的完全访问权。
2.2 Collaborative approach
协作方式
(1) China: Both sides will communicate and coordinate in advance on the
plans for inspection and investigation activities. The US side shall access
418
--- Page 427 (Text) ---
Meeting Continuing Obligations:
A Handbook for Companies Listed on Major Stock Exchanges
《履行持续义务：主要证券交易所上市公司手册》
audit working papers and other documents through the Chinese regulatory
authorities and conduct interviews and inquire relevant personnel of the
accounting firms with the participation and assistance of the China side.
中方：双方将提前就检查和调查活动计划进行沟通协调；美方须通
过中方监管部门调取审计底稿等文件，并在中方参与和协助下对会
计师事务所相关人员开展访谈和问询。
(2) US: The PCAOB has full discretion to select accounting firms for
inspection without consulting with Chinese regulators. The PCAOB can
view complete, unmodified audit working papers and can retain relevant
information as needed. At the same time, the PCAOB can directly
interview relevant personnel of the accounting firms being inspected or
investigated and obtain their testimonies.
美方：PCAOB 有完全的自由裁量权选择会计师事务所进行检查，
无须与中方监管部门协商；PCAOB 可以查看完整的、未经修改的
审计工作底稿，且可以根据需要保留相关信息。同时，PCAOB 可
以直接访谈被检查或调查的会计师事务所相关人员，并获取其证词。
2.3 Information security protection
信息安全保护
(1) China: The US-China Audit Oversight Co-operation Agreement includes
clear provisions on the handling and use of sensitive information that may
be involved in audit oversight co-operation and sets up special handling
procedures for specific data such as personal information.
中方：中美审计监管合作协议对于审计监管合作中可能涉及敏感信
息的处理和使用作出了明确约定，针对个人信息等特定数据设置了
专门的处理程序。
(2) US: For restricted data, including personal information, the PCAOB will
view it through a “view only” non-public program. The PCAOB may
retain all data (including restricted data) it obtains. The PCAOB may
provide all data (including restricted data) it obtains to the SEC, and the
SEC may use the data for any purposes.
美方：对于包括个人信息在内的“受限制数据”（Restricted Data），
PCAOB 将通过“仅查看”（View Only）的非公开程序进行查看；
PCAOB 可以保留其获取的全部数据（包括受限制数据）；PCAOB
可以向 SEC 提供其获取的全部数据（包括受限制数据），且 SEC 可
419
--- Page 428 (Text) ---
Meeting Continuing Obligations:
A Handbook for Companies Listed on Major Stock Exchanges
《履行持续义务：主要证券交易所上市公司手册》
以将相关数据用于 SEC的全部目的。
2.4 Regulatory approach
监管方式
(1) China: Each year, some accounting firms will be selected for random
inspection of their representative audit projects or audit projects with
potential quality risks, without having to inspect all audit projects of
companies listed in the US each year.
中方：每年抽选部分会计师事务所，抽查其有代表性或有潜在审计
质量风险的审计项目，无须每年检查全部在美上市公司审计项目。
(2) US: The PCAOB announced on December 15, 2022 that it has completed
its first cross-border audit inspection in Hong Kong. Generally, the
PCAOB conducts inspections on accounting firms every year or every 3
years. For large accounting firms that provide audit opinions for more than
100 listed companies, the PCAOB conduct inspections on them annually,
while for the other accounting firms, PCAOB generally conduct
inspections at least once every 3 years.
美方：PCAOB 已于 2022 年 12月 15日公告其完成了在香港开展的
首次跨境审计监管工作。一般来说，PCAOB会在每年或者每3年对
会计师事务所进行检查。对为 100 家以上的上市公司提供审计意见
的大型会计师事务所，PCAOB 每年检查一次，对其他会计师事务
所，PCAOB一般至少每 3年检查1次。
